Name,How it looks,What to do
With Parent - High Distress,"Child initiates contact, unmanaged state (crying, yelling, intense fear) towards parent.","Parent co-regulates (stay calm, offer comfort, validate, soothe); child cannot access coping skills independently."
With Parent - Moderate Distress,"Child initiates contact, distressed but more managed (worried, sad but verbal, approaching).","Parent validates feelings, supports child in using/accessing coping skills; co-regulates if needed."
With Parent - Acting Out,"Parent observes child's dysregulated behavior (throwing things, flailing, screaming) not aimed at parent; child not seeking help.","Parent ensures safety, sets boundary if needed (e.g., ""No throwing""), then co-regulates and seeks to understand trigger."
With Parent - Directed Aggression,Child initiates with physical (hitting) or intense verbal aggression (yelling insults) directed at parent.,"Parent ensures own safety, firmly states boundary (e.g., ""I won't let you hit me""), then co-regulates once aggression de-escalates."
With Parent - Over-Excited,"Child's positive emotion becomes too high, uncontrolled, difficulty responding to calming cues from parent.","Parent co-regulates to calm child, validates excitement then redirects energy (e.g., ""Wow, so much energy! Let's try a calming game."")."
With Parent - Withdrawn,"Parent observes child is ""shut down,"" unresponsive, not communicating.","Parent gently connects, offers safety & quiet presence (e.g., sit nearby), co-regulates without pressure for verbalization."
With Peers - High Distress,"Overwhelmed (crying, wailing, intense fear) in presence of peers; may/may not be directed at peers as call for help.","Show varied peer reactions (help, ignore, worsen) and distressed child's responses/coping attempts within the social dynamic."
With Peers - Moderate Distress,"Upset (crying softly, frustrated, verbalizing distress) with peers nearby; might try to get peer support.","Show child's attempts to communicate distress, self-regulate, or seek peer support; illustrate peer interactions & social problem-solving."
With Peers - Acting Out,"Dysregulated behavior (throwing shared toys, disrupting group) not aimed at specific peer but impacting group.","Show impact on group dynamics, varied peer reactions, and natural social consequences (e.g., game stops, peers withdraw)."
With Peers - Directed Aggression,"Physical (hitting, pushing) or intense verbal aggression directed at a peer.","Show immediate peer reactions to aggression, conflict, consequences, and potential peer interventions (safety focus for all)."
With Peers - Over-Excited,"Group energy or individual's energy becomes dysregulated, play gets wild/unsafe among peers.","Illustrate group dynamics with escalating energy, peer attempts to manage (or escalate further), and potential for accidents or game breakdown."
With Peers - Withdrawn,"Shuts down during peer interaction or in a group setting, becomes non-interactive.","Show child's internal state/coping attempts alongside varied peer (non)reactions (e.g., peers might not notice, or one might gently try to engage)."
Alone - High Distress,"Visibly overwhelmed by emotion when alone (uncontrolled crying, intense fear responses, no clear coping).","Show child's raw, unmanaged emotional state and any instinctual self-soothing attempts (e.g., hiding, holding self) or gradual shift."
Alone - Moderate Distress,"Upset when alone but not completely overwhelmed (soft crying, verbalizing feelings to self).","Show child actively attempting a learned coping strategy (e.g., breathing, self-talk, comfort object) and the internal process of trying to self-regulate."
Alone - Acting Out,"Dysregulated behavior (throwing things around room generally, flailing) when alone, unmanaged energy.","Show child's unmanaged energy release and its potential (accidental) negative consequences (e.g., a toy breaks, makes a mess, leading to a new feeling)."
Alone - Directed Aggression,"Directs physical aggression (hitting, kicking, throwing) at toys, furniture, etc., out of intense emotion.","Show child's intense physical expression of emotion on objects and potential resulting feelings or self-discoveries (e.g., regret, calm, realization of broken toy)."
Alone - Over-Excited,"Becomes dysregulated from positive emotion when alone, play becomes wild, loses control.","Show child's escalating energy leading to natural consequences (e.g., minor accident like tripping, making a large mess, which might then shift their state)."
Alone - Withdrawn,"Shuts down alone due to an internal feeling or recent event, becomes passive and unresponsive to environment.","Show child's internal shutdown, quietness, and any slow internal shift or subtle environmental trigger (e.g., sunlight, a familiar sound) that starts re-engagement."
