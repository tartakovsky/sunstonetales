### 3.3. Specialized Editing & Audit Protocols

#### The Integrated Editor/Gatekeeper Protocol
*   **Goal:** Perform a comprehensive quality assessment, identifying every failure to meet standards and providing targeted, actionable fixes.
*   **Execution:** Analyze the draft sequentially, beat-by-beat. If a beat is perfect, state "**Beat X.X: No issues found.**" For problematic beats, provide:
    1.  **Diagnosis:** Quote text, assign labels, identify constraint violated.
    2.  **Prescription:** State a Rewrite Goal, explain the Proposed Solution, and provide a Rewritten Example.

*   **Output Format:**
    ```
    **[INTEGRATED GATEKEEPER REPORT]**
    
    **Beat 1.1: [Setting Introduction]**
    *Either: No issues found*
    *Or problematic passages with:*
    *   **Text:**
        > [Quote problematic passage]
    *   **Diagnosis:** `[DIAGNOSTIC LABEL(S)]`
    *   **Beat Constraint Violated:** [Specific constraint for this beat]
    *   **Fix:** [Specific revision strategy]
    *   **Rewritten Example:**
        > [2-4 sentences showing the fix]
    
    **CONVERGENCE SUMMARY:**
    - **Iteration #**: [Track which round this is]
    - **Previous Issues Addressed**: [How this draft improved from last feedback]
    - **Remaining Problems**: [Key issues still requiring fixes]
    - **Next Iteration Focus**: [Specific priorities for revision]
    ```

#### Narrative Polish & Deepening Protocol
*   **Goal:** A final polish to ensure the storyboard is tight, psychologically sound, and maximally engaging.
*   **Process:** For each beat, analyze and refine:
    1.  **Narrative Tightness & Pacing:** Edit for conciseness. Is the sequence of events logical and compelling? Cut or rephrase anything that slows the pace unnecessarily.
    2.  **Psychological & Emotional Arc:** Verify the "show, then tell" method. Detail co-regulation steps and internal reflections.
    3.  **Character & World Integrity:** Ensure character actions are consistent with their traits. Refine environmental descriptions to enhance mood. Check metaphor usage.
    4.  **Engagement & "Fun Factor":** Sprinkle in fun, micro-tensions, and evocative language. Ensure fun is character-specific.

#### Engagement & Fun Enhancement Protocol
*   **Goal:** Inject high-impact emotional snippets, fun interactions, and micro-tension.
*   **Process:** Review each beat for entertainment value. Is it boring? Can it be punchier?
*   **Output Format:** For each beat, provide:
    1.  A brief **Review** of the current beat's engagement level.
    2.  Actionable **Suggestions** for improvement, including:
        *   Changes to the scene or dialogue.
        *   Several suggested new **Punchy Snippet** suggestions (a specific line of dialogue or action).

*   **Example Format:**
    ```
    ### Beat X.Y
    **Text:** 
    > [Original text of the beat]
    
    **Review:**
    > A brief analysis of what works and what's boring.
    
    **Suggestions:**
    > - Concrete ideas to make the beat more engaging.
    > - 5 **Punchy Snippet:** suggestions [A specific line of dialogue or action]
    ```

#### Engagement & Fun Analysis Protocol
*   **Goal:** Analyze existing engagement techniques and identify opportunities for improvement.
*   **Process:** For each moment in the story where engagement is used or could be improved:

*   **Existing Engagement Analysis:**
    ```
    ### Existing Engagement: [Brief description of the scene]
    *   **Location:** [Quote the relevant text from the manuscript.]
    *   **Engagement Type Identified:** [Identify the specific engagement type from `@engagement_types.csv`.]
    *   **Analysis:** [Comment on the effectiveness of the implementation.]
    ```

*   **Opportunities for New Engagement:**
    ```
    ### Opportunity for Engagement: [Brief description of the scene or moment]
    *   **Location:** [Quote the text that could be modified.]
    *   **Reasoning:** [Explain why this specific moment needs improvement.]
    *   **Suggested Engagement Type:** [Propose a specific engagement type.]
    *   **Suggested Implementation:** [Provide a concrete example of the new text.]
    ```

#### Psychological Audit Protocol (Simplified)
*   **Goal:** A focused audit against core psychological and developmental guidelines.
*   **Output Format:**
    ```
    ### Location: [Brief description of the scene]
    *   **Expectation:** [Description of the expectation being checked.]
        *   **Fulfilled:** [Yes/No/Not Applicable]

## PART 4: ITERATIVE PROCESS & PROSE GENERATION

### 4.1. Iterative Development & Convergence
*   **Feedback Integration System:**
    *   **Memory Carry-Forward:** Address specific feedback from the previous iteration without overcorrecting.
    *   **Constraint Balance:** If a previous version was "too developmental," increase engagement without losing teaching value, and vice-versa.
*   **Convergence Strategies:**
    *   **Round 1:** Optimize for story appeal while meeting developmental minimums.
    *   **Round 2:** Address gatekeeper feedback while maintaining narrative momentum.
    *   **Round 3+:** Find middle-ground compromises satisfying all requirements.
*   **Convergence Summary Format:**
    *   **Iteration #:** Track which round this is.
    *   **Previous Issues Addressed:** How this draft improved from last feedback.
    *   **Remaining Problems:** Key issues still requiring fixes.
    *   **Next Iteration Focus:** Specific priorities for revision.

### 4.2. Prose Generation Protocol
*   **Role:** Expert children's book author for ages 4-6.
*   **Objective:** Transform the final narrative outline into polished, simple, engaging prose suitable for being read aloud.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each `## Act` and `### Beat` heading, write the final prose directly beneath it.
    *   Replicate the headings exactly. **NEVER** translate the English headings.
    *   Provide ONLY the final prose. Omit all original notes, suggestions, or metadata from the storyboard.

### 4.3. Translation Guidelines
*   **Cultural Adaptation:** Adapt the English concept document for a Russian (or whichever target language is) audience.
*   **Language Quality:** Use localized, natural, fluent, and idiomatic Russian. The tone should be conversational.
*   **Translation Priority:** Do not translate literally. The priority is to convey the core meaning, intent, and nuance in a way that feels native to the Russian language.
*   **Vocabulary:** Avoid clinical or academic jargon; instead, find simple, clear, and natural ways to express the concepts.
*   **Metaphors:** Keep the metaphors intact whenever possible, but do not translate literally. Make them idiomatic.

### 4.4. Complete Prose Generation Example

**Input (From Storyboard):**
```
## Act 1: Introduction
### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere

**SCENE:** Liska's den at night.
In the quiet den, a moonbeam paints a silver stripe on the floor. Liska, curious, tries to pounce on the "puddle of light," patting it in confusion when she finds it's dry. The scene establishes a feeling of safety and playful wonder.

**Suggestions:**
> - Heighten the comedic anticlimax by emphasizing Liska's very serious "hunter" preparations before the pounce.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** Liska's little bottom gives a mighty wiggle before she leaps.
```

**Expected Output (Final Prose):**
```
## Act 1: Introduction
### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere

Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam. She pressed low to the ground. Her bottom gave a little wiggle and...

She pounced like a tiny predator! But her paw only patted the floor with a little *fump*. Liska furrowed her brows in confusion.
```

### 4.5. AI-Specific Constraints
*   Omit all self-references, apologies, or meta-commentary.
*   Terminate the response immediately after delivering the requested prose.
