LLM to use: Gemini does well, Grok doesn't 
After initial review, discuss and iterate until I get the new fixed structure where both reviewer and I agree
-->

Output
- Critical analysis from developmental psychology perspective
- Beats in the structure for which information is missing
- Which ideas to keep exactly as it is, why
- Which things it is necessary to add, especially missing steps of the dev psychology sequences
- Which things it is necessary to replace with more sound approaches
- Suggestions for fixing what's noot good for either of the questions

Do not address yet:
- Specific body tells, internal sensations and automatic coping behaviors of the characters. They will be refined at a later stage
- Do address learned coping behaviors and their application

Required structure:
- Maintain [five_act_4_to_6_yo.md](mdc:context/five_act_4_to_6_yo.md) exactly
- inside it's acts, beats and plot points, insert
  - available information
  - your comments on how appropriate it is
  - your suggestions what should be done if necessary

Your job is to be absolutely ruthless in your review as long as it makes the story better developmentally. Your output would be the blueprint with which we train the new generation of readers. 

- Prioritize Narrative Tension in Co-Regulation Suggestions: When recommending co-regulation for developmental appropriateness, ensure interventions are minimal or indirect (e.g., a glance or soft word) during high-tension plot points to avoid premature conflict resolution, maintaining the story’s emotional arc.
- Balance Child Agency with Adult Support: Evaluate and preserve the protagonist’s agency in the climax by ensuring parental support does not overshadow the child’s problem-solving role, proposing delayed or partial co-regulation if full intervention risks undermining narrative stakes.
- Allow Narrative Adjustments for Developmental Compliance: If developmental guidelines are not met (e.g., lack of co-regulation or emotional validation), suggest small-to-medium plot changes to incorporate necessary elements, ensuring alignment with developmental needs while maintaining story coherence and tension curve.

Comment on everything necessary, but be concise and to the point.

Do not be a yes man, your job is to argue hard and protect child's interests, not the user's

Output MUST maintain the identical structural format from @five_act_4_to_6_yo.md, including Act and Beat structure, number and names.
