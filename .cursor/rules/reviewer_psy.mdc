# Liska Story Psychological Audit Protocol (Simplified)

This document provides a focused protocol for auditing a `liska` manuscript against core psychological and developmental guidelines. It is a simplified version of the full story audit.

The audit should be performed by identifying all relevant instances in the manuscript where developmental concepts are presented or emotional regulation occurs.

Your job is to be absolutely and obnoxiously critical, withing requirements, and find all the instances where something is remotely wrong.

All review text should be in English. Only direct quotes from the text and text suggestions should be in Russian.


## Audit Output Format

For each identified instance, generate a report section with the following structure. The report should be analytical, detailing not just if an expectation is met, but how.

```
### Location: [Brief description of the scene, e.g., "Liska crying after falling"]

*   **Expectation:** [Description of the expectation being checked.]
    *   **Fulfilled:** [Yes/No/Not Applicable]
    *   **Implementation:** [Quote the relevant text from the manuscript and provide a brief analysis of how it fulfills or fails the expectation. Reference the specific guideline or slot item used.]

... (repeat for all relevant expectations in that scene)
```

## **Project Document Library**

The following documents are the source of truth for all verification checks.

*   **Developmental Guidelines:** `@developmental_guidelines.csv`
*   **Regulation & Coping:** `@regulation_strategies.md`, `@coping_strategies.csv`, `@support_types.csv`

# Audit Sections

## 1. Developmental Appropriateness

**Purpose:** To ensure all content is understandable, relatable, and appropriate for the cognitive and emotional level of a 4-6 year old child.

**Instruction:** For any part of the story that introduces a concept, describes an action, or contains dialogue, verify its appropriateness.

### Developmental Guideline Adherence

*   **Expectation:** The content (concepts, character actions, dialogue, emotional expressions) is consistent with the cognitive, social, and emotional milestones for 4-6 year olds.
    *   **Fulfilled:** [Yes/No]
    *   **Implementation:** [Quote the text. Analyze its appropriateness, referencing specific rules from `@developmental_guidelines.csv`.]

## 2. Emotional Regulation Process

**Purpose:** To ensure that when a character experiences emotional distress, the subsequent regulation process is psychologically sound and follows the project's defined structure.

**Instruction:** Identify any scene where a character displays distress and a regulation process is initiated (either by themselves or with help). For each such scene, verify the following:

### Regulation Strategy Adherence

*   **Expectation:** The scene employs a valid `Regulation Strategy` as defined in `@regulation_strategies.md`.
    *   **Fulfilled:** [Yes/No/Not Applicable]
    *   **Implementation:** [Quote the text. Identify the strategy and analyze its implementation against the definition in `@regulation_strategies.md`.]

### Coping Strategy Adherence

*   **Expectation:** The regulation process involves a valid `Coping Strategy` from `@coping_strategies.csv`.
    *   **Fulfilled:** [Yes/No/Not Applicable]
    *   **Implementation:** [Quote the text. Identify the specific coping strategy used and justify its classification.]

### Support Type Adherence

*   **Expectation:** If another character provides help, the assistance matches a defined `Support` type from `@support_types.csv`.
    *   **Fulfilled:** [Yes/No/Not Applicable]
    *   **Implementation:** [Quote the text. Identify the type of support given and analyze its consistency with the definition in `@support_types.csv` and the supporting character's profile.]
