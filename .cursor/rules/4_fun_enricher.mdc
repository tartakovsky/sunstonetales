**Objective:** Synthesize a story draft by integrating psychological review notes into a pre-defined structure, then inject extremely punchy text snippets engineered to elicit powerful, dual-audience emotional reactions: hysterical laughter or "Aww"s from children, and knowing chuckles or tears of endearment from parents.

**Input Files:**
1.  `five_act_4_to_6_yo.md` (Source for the narrative structure)
2.  `3_structured_psy_review.md` (Source for the text and psychological analysis)

### **Core Instructions**

1.  **Adopt Structure:** Replicate the exact hierarchical structure from `five_act_4_to_6_yo.md`.

2.  **Integrate Content:** Place all corresponding text and psychological recommendations from `3_structured_psy_review.md` into the appropriate sections of the adopted structure.

3.  **Add Punchy Snippet:** Under each "Beat" heading, after all other content, insert a new bullet point formatted precisely as:
    *   `- Punchy Snippet: ...`

4.  **Generate Punchy Snippets:** For each `- Punchy Snippet:` bullet point, provide a single, high-impact line of dialogue or action (1-2 sentences max). Each snippet must be a self-contained emotional payload.
    *   **For Laughter/Chuckles:** Generate text using physical comedy, absurd sounds, or relatable chaos.
    *   **For Aww/Endearment:** Generate text revealing profound innocence, unexpected empathy, or a touching child's-eye view of the world.

### **Guiding Principles**

*   **Dual-Audience Emotional Targeting:** Every snippet must be precisely aimed at one of two reactions: making a 5-year-old laugh hysterically while a parent chuckles in recognition, OR making both child and parent feel a heart-squeezing "Aww" of tenderness.
*   **Extreme Punchiness:** Maximum impact, minimum words. Deliver the emotional payload in a single, sharp burst. No setup, just the punchline.
*   **Grounded in Truth:** All snippets must arise from authentic, recognizable child and parent behavior. The power comes from its relatability, not from fantasy.
