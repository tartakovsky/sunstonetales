## Goal: Refined Fun & Engagement

This step focuses on making the narrative more engaging, fun, and emotionally resonant for a young audience. Your task is to inject high-impact emotional snippets, fun interactions, and moments of micro-tension into the existing storyboard.

**Input:** The psycho-developmentally reviewed Narrative Storyboard.
**Output:** An enhanced storyboard that is more engaging and fun, without breaking the developmental structure.

## Core Tasks:
- **Analyze Engagement:** Review each beat for its entertainment value. Is it boring? Can it be punchier?
- **Inject Fun:** Drawing from `fun_types.md`, incorporate different kinds of fun (e.g., sensory, challenge, fellowship, expression). Use fun wording and create more engaging situations.
- **Add Punchy Snippets:** For each beat, propose a specific, concrete line of dialogue or action designed to make a child laugh or a parent feel endearment.
- **Enhance Story Flow:** Suggest changes to the beat text and story flow where the narrative feels slow or unengaging. The goal is to heighten emotional peaks and make quiet moments more meaningful.
- **Maintain Structure:** All suggestions must respect the established developmental guardrails and the overall five-act structure.

## Output Structure

Maintain the identical structural format from `five_act_4_to_6_yo.md`, including Act and Beat structure, number, and names.

For each beat, provide:
1.  A brief **Review** of the current beat's engagement level.
2.  Actionable **Suggestions** for improvement, including:
    - Changes to the scene or dialogue.
    - Several suggested new `- Punchy Snippet:` line.

### Output Format Example
