You need to read your all of your raw input files and 1_problem_extration.md file. 

You must read the structure:
- [five_act_4_to_6_yo.md](mdc:context/five_act_4_to_6_yo.md)

You must output the structure exactly as it is into 2_structure_draft.md

Keeping the full structure intact, start inserting information out of input files into it. 

The goal is not to finalized everything, but to make a first draft of it that will then be used for brainstorming whether developmental sequences are correct and so on. 


You must follow the stucture EXACTLY and fit everything into it. All the acts and beats in them.

Similar to that:
## Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins
### 2.1: Lead-up
Events that set the stage for the problem. This is an opportunity to showcase fun character behaviors based on their humor profiles and engagement types.
- Slot: `Fun`: No information
- Slot: `Engagement`: Tension, which specifically

For every act and beat. Everything should be in place. Fill slots you have information for, mark the ones you don't as "No information". 
Do not invent slots, only use the ones mentioned in the structure. Output the rest as normal text inside the plot points.
