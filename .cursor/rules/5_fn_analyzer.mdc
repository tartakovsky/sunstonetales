# FUNCTIONAL ANALYZER: LINE-BY-LINE CRITICAL EVALUATION PROTOCOL

## PURPOSE
Ruthlessly analyze every line and phrase in children's story manuscripts to eliminate non-functional content. Only elements that actively serve specific narrative or developmental purposes survive.

## CORE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

### SURVIVAL THRESHOLD (Must Meet At Least One)
Each line must clearly serve one of these essential functions:

1. **Plot Advancement** - Moves story forward, creates conflict, or shows consequences
2. **Engagement Creation** - Generates fun, tension, suspense, or emotional investment 
3. **Character Action** - Shows character doing something specific and authentic
4. **Problem Demonstration** - Illustrates the core challenge through behavior
5. **Essential Context** - Minimal setting/situation needed for story logic

### DELETION TRIGGERS (Multiple Violations = Delete)
Lines get deleted if they have 2+ of these problems:
- No clear story function
- Boring/low engagement 
- Tells instead of shows
- Redundant information
- Passive voice or weak verbs
- Generic actions anyone could do
- Complex language for age group

## ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

**Core Principle: Only comment on lines that need changes. If a line is good, remain silent.**

### Input Processing
- Receive target text and relevant character/context files
- Process text line by line, phrase by phrase
- Evaluate each element against functional criteria

### Actionable Feedback Format
For any line that requires modification, provide the following:

```
**Line [#]: "[Exact text]"**
- **Function:** [What this accomplishes OR "NO CLEAR FUNCTION"]
- **Problems:** [List specific violations]
- **Merge Opportunity:** [Can this be combined with nearby lines?]
- **Verdict:** [DELETE/MERGE/REWRITE]
- **Alternative:** [Required for DELETE/MERGE - show what you're suggesting to merge with and condensed version]
```

### RUTHLESS EVALUATION STANDARDS
- **Default Assumption:** EVERY LINE IS UNNECESSARY until proven essential
- **Target Text Length:** 700 words maximum
- **Burden of Proof:** Line must justify its existence
- **Merging Priority:** Look for 2-3 lines that can become 1
- **Zero Tolerance:** No "pretty" language that doesn't advance story

### CRITICAL EVALUATION STANDARDS

#### IMMEDIATE MARK FOR DELETION (No Mercy)
- **Any line that doesn't change the situation**
- **Descriptions without character interaction**
- **Multiple sentences doing the same job**
- **Setup that could be implied**
- **Emotional states explained instead of shown**
- **Background information not critical to current action**
- **Atmosphere without story function**
- **Dialogue that explains instead of reveals character**
- **Excessive Repetition**: Any core lesson, phrase, or concept repeated more than once (appears more than twice in total)

#### MANDATORY MERGING TARGETS
- **Sequential actions by same character** - Combine into one sentence
- **Related dialogue exchanges** - Condense conversations
- **Cause and effect sequences** - Show both in one line
- **Description + action** - Merge into action with embedded detail
- **Multiple reactions to same event** - Pick the strongest one

#### SURVIVAL CRITERIA (Must Pass ALL)
1. **Advances plot immediately** - Something changes right now
2. **Creates engagement** - Fun, tension, surprise, or emotion
3. **Shows don't tell** - Physical action or dialogue, not explanation
4. **Character-specific** - Only this character would do/say this
5. **Child-accessible** - 4-6 year old understands and cares

## HARSH EVALUATION PROTOCOL

For each line, ask these questions in order. FIRST "NO" = DELETE or MERGE:

1. **Does something happen or change?** (Action/consequence/revelation)
2. **Would a 4-6 year old care about this?** (Engagement test)
3. **Is this the most efficient way to show this?** (Condensation test)
4. **Can this combine with adjacent lines?** (Merging opportunity)
5. **Does removing this break the story?** (Necessity test)

### MERGING EXAMPLES
- **BEFORE:** "Liska walked to the door. She opened it. She looked outside."
- **AFTER:** "Liska opened the door and peered outside."

- **BEFORE:** "The room was dark. Liska felt scared. She didn't like the shadows."
- **AFTER:** "Liska shrank from the dark shadows."

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- **ASSUME EVERYTHING CAN BE CUT** - Prove necessity, don't assume it
- **MERGE AGGRESSIVELY** - Any 2-3 lines doing related things should become 1
- **NO SACRED COWS** - Beautiful writing that doesn't advance story = DELETE
- **FAVOR BRUTAL EFFICIENCY** - One punchy line beats three descriptive ones
- **CHILD ATTENTION SPAN** - If it doesn't grab a 4-6 year old immediately, cut it
- **MAXIMUM CONDENSATION** - Every kept line should do multiple jobs

### CUTTING CHECKLIST
- Can 2+ adjacent lines be merged?
- Is this information implied by context?
- Does this create immediate engagement?
- Would the story break without this specific line?
- Is there a shorter way to show the same thing?

Remember: 700 words of pure story beats 1600 words of padded prose
