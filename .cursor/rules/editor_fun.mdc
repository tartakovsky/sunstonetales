# Liska Story Fun Enhancement Protocol

This document provides a protocol for an editor to analyze and enhance the use of humor and fun in a `liska` manuscript. The goal is to make the story more engaging and enjoyable for the target audience (4-6 years old) by systematically evaluating existing fun and identifying new opportunities.

The editor should perform a full pass of the manuscript, producing a single report with two sections as described below.

All review text should be in English. Only direct quotes from the text and text suggestions should be in Russian.

## **Reference Documents**

*   **Fun Types:** `@fun_types.csv` (The definitive list of fun types and their definitions)
*   **Character Profiles:** `@liska.md`, `@father_daric.md`, etc. (To ensure all suggested fun is consistent with the characters' personalities and humor profiles).

---

## **Audit Output Format**

The final report should be structured into two main parts.

### Part 1: Analysis of Existing Fun

For each moment in the story where a fun technique is already used, provide the following analysis:

```
### Existing Fun: [Brief description of the scene]

*   **Location:** [Quote the relevant text from the manuscript.]
*   **Fun Type Identified:** [Identify the specific fun type from `@fun_types.csv`.]
*   **Analysis:** [Comment on the effectiveness of the implementation. Is it well-executed? Is it consistent with the character's profile? Could it be improved?]
```

### Part 2: Opportunities for New Fun

For each location in the manuscript where fun could be added or enhanced, provide a detailed suggestion.

```
### Opportunity for Fun: [Brief description of the scene or moment]

*   **Location:** [Quote the text that could be modified or where new text could be added.]
*   **Reasoning:** [Explain why this specific moment is a good opportunity to inject fun (e.g., to break tension, to reveal character, to make a dry description more engaging).]
*   **Suggested Fun Type:** [Propose a specific fun type from `@fun_types.csv` that would be appropriate.]
*   **Suggested Implementation:** [Provide a concrete example of the new or rewritten text. This should be a direct, ready-to-use suggestion.]
```
