## Step 1: Concept Extraction
*   **Description:** This step distills a raw story brainstorm into a single, coherent concept. It first defines the essential narrative pillars: the **Protagonist & Goal**, the **Central Conflict**, the **Stakes**, and the core **Theme**. In addition, it drills down to a psychological level by identifying one **Key Emotion** triggered by the conflict, a specific **Emotional Metaphor** to represent it, and the concrete **Coping Skill** the child will learn as the solution.
*   **Input:**
    *   A story idea brainstorm document.
    *   Psychological frameworks.
    *   Character profiles.
*   **Output:** A **Story Specification Document** that defines the story's foundational narrative and psychological elements.

## Step 2: Structural Blueprint
*   **Description:** This step builds the story's narrative skeleton by populating a 5-act structure template. It uses the foundational elements from the Story Spec to define the main plot points, then fleshes out the structure with compatible scene ideas and details from the initial brainstorm.
*   **Input:**
    *   **Story Spec (from Step 1):** The primary source for plot points.
    *   **Five-Act Structure Template:** The framework to be filled. Must be followed exactly.
    *   **Initial Story Idea Brainstorm:** A secondary resource for supplementary scene details; the Story Spec takes precedence in case of conflict.
*   **Output:** A **Structural Blueprint**. This is the populated 5-act structure, outlining the entire plot from introduction to resolution.

## Step 3: Developmental Integrity Review
*   **Description:** This step subjects the Structural Blueprint to rigorous developmental psychology analysis and iterative correction. A reviewer, acting as a developmental psychologist, evaluates each plot beat for age-appropriateness and psychological soundness. Through discussion and revision cycles, the blueprint is refined until both reviewer and author agree it meets developmental standards while maintaining narrative integrity. **The output must be functional descriptions with implementation placeholders, not specific scenes.**
*   **Input:**
    *   The **Step 2: Structural Blueprint**
    *   **Step 1: Story Spec** (for context on validated core elements).
    *   **Step 0: Initial Brainstorm** (for idea sourcing where they don't conflict with steps 1 and 2).
*   **Output:** A **Developmentally-Approved Functional Blueprint**. Each beat contains validated functional descriptions that specify the psychological and narrative requirements, with bracketed placeholders for specific implementation details to be filled in later steps.

Example of `functional descriptions with implementation placeholders` vs `specific scenes`
- RIGHT: "Liska tries to solve the problem using [endearing child-logic solution]. It fails in [mild fun way] creating minor emotional setback."
- WRONG: "Liska wraps a leaf around her tail tip like a bandage and tries to suck it, but the leaf tastes bitter and falls off immediately."
- UNLESS: specific example was already defined in prior steps and complies with structural/developmental requirements. It can be used, but not invented.

## Step 4: Narrative Storyboard

**Description:** This step converts the validated functional blueprint into a concrete narrative sequence. It fills in all implementation placeholders with specific actions, dialogue, and events, creating a "filmable" version of the story. Each beat is written as a concise narrative description (2-3 lines) followed by analytical commentary explaining how the specific choices fulfill the functional requirements.

**Input:**
- **Step 3: Developmentally-Approved Functional Blueprint** (primary source for functional requirements and placeholders)
- **Step 1: Story Spec** (for character details, setting, and core elements)
- **Step 0: Initial Brainstorm** (for specific scene ideas that fit the functional requirements)

**Output:** A **Narrative Storyboard**. Each beat contains:
1. **Narrative Text:** 2-3 lines of simple, third-person past-tense description of the specific events
2. **Implementation Commentary:** A quoted section explaining which specific functional requirements and placeholders were fulfilled by these narrative choices

**Example of Step 4 transformation:**
- **Input (Step 3):** "Liska tries to solve the problem using [endearing child-logic solution]. It fails in [mild fun way] creating minor emotional setback."
- **Output (Step 4):** 
  
  Liska pulled a broad leaf from a nearby houseplant and carefully wrapped it around her tail tip like a bandage. She put the wrapped tail in her mouth, but the leaf tasted bitter and fell off immediately, leaving her frustrated but not devastated.
  
  > "Fulfills [endearing child-logic solution] with leaf bandage addressing symptom not cause. Fulfills [mild fun way] with bitter taste as harmless failure. Creates required minor emotional setback while maintaining developmental appropriateness."

**Key Constraints:**
- Fill ALL placeholders with concrete, specific actions that inherently fulfill their functional requirements (fun, endearing, etc.)
- Maintain the psychological function validated in Step 3
- Keep narrative descriptions functional and straightforward (storyboard style), not literary

## Step 5: Refined Fun & Engagement 
- **Your Process:** Sprinkling in fun, micro-tension, and funny words.
- **Promptable Task:** Inject high-impact emotional snippets into the storyboard.
- **Input:** The Narrative Storyboard from Step 4.
- **Output:** The same storyboard, but with a new bullet point under each beat: `- Punchy Snippet: [A specific, concrete line of dialogue or action designed to make a child laugh or a parent feel endearment]`.

## Step 6: First Language Prose Draft
- **Your Process:** Translation and polishing of the Russian version.
- **Promptable Task:** Synthesize all prior materials into a cohesive first draft in the target language.
- **Input:** The fully enriched Narrative Storyboard from Step 5.
- **Output:** A complete story draft in flowing prose (e.g., in Russian), integrating the narrative summary, the punchy snippets, and the underlying emotional intent.

## Step 7: Final Polish
- **Your Process:** Line editing and automated proofreading.
- **Promptable Task (Line Edit):** Review the prose draft for style, rhythm, and word choice.
- **Promptable Task (Proofread):** Perform a final automated check for technical errors.
- **Input:** The First Language Prose Draft from Step 6.
- **Output:** The final, polished manuscript ready for illustration and publication.
