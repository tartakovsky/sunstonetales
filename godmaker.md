Godmaker Experiment

- portal Isekai
- not humans
- progression fantasy
- Cradle like but artificial planet for making "gods"
- tutorials and zones, but not named such
- few abilities that develop intricately
- upgradable weapons
- Sentient AI
- tech camouflaged as magic but peaking out in places, weirding out characters
- Guilds. Adventurers guild like with quests, but named differently
- Gothic 1/2 vibes. Prison slang and so on
- Assassin fantasy
- Two main characters, not together at the start
- Machiavellian manipulative sensual girl who is actually a trained killer, jaded but soft inside
- Smart guy who becomes an assassin in the new world and approaches it quite rationally, without notions like honor and so on. If he needs to kill, he finds a way to do it with less risk through poison, traps, delegation, whatever.

- Which weapons do I want for MC and Silahri?
- How would they be upgradable?
- Some energy conductive material for the blade. Weird metal with crystal veins or something? Full crystal?
- Feeding it energy would allow evolutions similar to what symbiotes do? Or there is an actual crystalline symbiote inside that does various skill-like stuff
- Eventually Sarmadi living in the weapon, communicating in images and impressions, guiding MCs hand toward weak points
- Normal hilt, in the future upgradable to high tech
- Poison / acid
- Expandable energy edge
- Long dagger? Something else?

MC Weapon loadout:
- off hand spiked buckler or clawed gauntlet
- steel garrote 
- throwing knives
- constructed scripted pneumatic gun. Arbalet before that? Not bow

Main weapon
**Modular Short Glaive / Dagger**

**1. Component: Dagger**
*   **Blade Length:** 20cm
*   **Design:** A standalone dagger with a single curved cutting edge, a reinforced thrusting point, and a standard hilt with a perpendicular crossguard.

**2. Component: Blade-Side Handle Section**
*   **Length:** 40cm
*   **Form:** The forward section is thicker to house the mounting hardware, tapering down to a standard grip diameter towards its base.
*   **Mounting Mechanism:**
    *   **Trough:** A U-shaped groove is carved into the handle, sized to perfectly cradle the dagger's hilt.
    *   **Hinged Gate:** A solid steel block, the "gate," is attached to the very front of the handle by a heavy-duty side hinge. This gate has a thin, blade-sized slot cut through its center.
    *   **Lock:** A lever on the side of the handle drives a hardened steel pin horizontally through the handle and the gate, locking it shut.
*   **Connection:** Features the female end of a robust twist-lock mechanism at its base.

**3. Component: Grip-Side Handle Section**
*   **Length:** 40cm
*   **Form:** A pole of standard, uniform grip diameter.
*   **Connection:** Features the male end of the twist-lock mechanism.
*   **Pommel:** A weighted cap for balance.

**Assembly Process**
1.  The two handle sections are joined via their twist-lock connection.
2.  With the hinged gate swung open, the dagger's hilt is laid down into the U-shaped trough.
3.  The steel gate is swung shut. The dagger's blade passes through the slot in the gate, which now sits directly in front of the dagger's crossguard, blocking it from moving forward.
4.  The side lever is flipped, driving the locking pin through the handle and gate to secure the entire assembly for combat.

So character wakes up just from getting from a blacking out into a world. We do not do anything preliminary. We try to maintain the air of mystery so they just wake up in a weird place. with like what the fuck where I am maybe this foggy memory for now that will be revealed they wake up in a kind of mine like in Gothic 1 where there is a group of miners sitting around they just look at him and say like another one and look away

Then someone brings him to the processing center where basically the new arrivals are introduced. Very briefly. So nobody gives him like a course or anything, so it's kind of just a crash course. that's like oh you are like we don't give a fuck where you're from. Now you are in the mine, and your job is to mine. If you want to eat – mine. they give him the very basic tools like the pickaxe and a bag or something they show him what to mine and they show him like where he can get food and so on and then they leave him alone to do whatever


There are three factions at least in the area, but only, like he sees only one faction of basically miners, let's call them the tunnelers. So they live in that shanty town basically on top of the entrance to the mines.

So we will be revealing his memories gradually. The character is from Siberia, so we will be giving him flashes of memory of snowy forests, mountains maybe and something like that. then maybe modern cities and so on slowly slowly revealing the background without ever saying where he's exactly from

So the character, like there's some scenes there that we should show some integration into that mining society, but eventually he starts mining. He goes down into the mines and starts doing something there. But some of the sub-faction from the tunnelers starts bullying him.

The typical way it goes is that they bully the new arrival and they extract attacks basically from all their mining. So instead of going to the tunnelers, like first, I don't know, 30% of what the new arrival mines goes to the sub-faction. Effectively stealing from both the new arrival and the tunneler faction.

So the character does not stand for it. Here is the question of in what way exactly, so he can either fight or he can just go and ask the tunnel or representative guy. It's like, is it normal that some assholes want to take attacks? Or should I just bring it all directly to you?

That creates problems for the sub-faction of the guys who extorted him and now they really hate him. It is completely forbidden, like the violence, especially the organized violence is forbidden inside the faction. because the faction tries to enforce some comparatively safe working conditions to get as much ore as possible.

So the enforcers from the faction go to the sub-faction, they intimidate them and they dock their pay or something for a while. So the sub-faction gets poorer and now they are under constant suspicion and observation, which triggers animosity towards the main character.

But they can't do anything overtly, so instead of openly beating or doing something bad to the character they start hunting him in the mines when he goes deeper and try to ambush him

There should be some plot in between all of that, but eventually the character gets ambushed by two guys and by some stroke of luck and maybe a little bit of skill he kills them in some remote corner of the mine.

Now here we start doing the litRPG thing and because of killing them and getting the energy out of them something starts happening to him

The backstory there that we do not explain or do not show to the reader yet is that when the character was abducted from his homeworld, there was like a symbiont organism that was integrated into him that allows for working with energy, with arcana. like in the litRPG style, developing abilities and so on.

I want to avoid the overt like leveling and character sheets as in these litRPGs. So I want to narrate all of that in a more natural way. So instead of system prompts that these books typically have and like floating UI, instead I would make it something like a voice in his head and maybe flashing images or something so we do not have a systematic UI or something instead we have kind of this weird mysterious things that are intruding into his head

And the things should somehow lead him to the progression. Here it needs to be heavily brainstormed, like how do we present this progression, but the underlying system is that we lead him to some sort of abilities that lead him towards being an assassin.

The sub-faction after losing two people starts seriously hunting the main character, but they don't know that he developed the abilities. So he realizes that for him it's no longer safe to go deep into the mines at all, that he'll be hunted every time. So he starts getting into that assassin persona and playing traps, hiding and figuring out in some other way how to survive and kill other guys.

But he needs to do it in a way that it does not lead to him. So it would be maybe done in a way that it creates a mystery of someone hunting people deep in the mines. And given that the deeper you are, the more chance that there is some monster there, it's plausible so people believe it but he like organizes his kills in a way so they don't directly lead to a normal person

So after couple of these encounters, maybe three of them, we need to ramp up the stakes, make it into a huge confrontation, which he either needs to win, but then to deal with the fallout, or he needs to escape. that fallout or the escape or the victory give him the opportunity to move on from the tunnelers function deeper into the territory of the mines the above ground territory and to connect with other factions

World building wise, so this place where the character is, is kind of an artificial world. It's separated into zones in a bunch of different ways. Each of the managers of the place have their own systems. how the progression is managed so they experiment in their own way in the area where the character is it is not adult represented so it's done in the way I said before where kind of images and thoughts pop up in their head, but they are not directly managed. The idea is that the experiment is that the progression should be natural extension of what the character feels and decides instead of leading them into a set number of classes and so on.

So each of the managers have their own territories, like let's say starting territories, where the completely new people come in and they somehow manage to prevail through adversity finish this let's say starting tiers and then we want to hire one and this each of these tiers have like basically societies so they're like countries or something and each of those countries or I don't know, continents or something are separate and it's not easy to get from one management territory to another up to the point that there is only rumors that other territories exist. But then the higher level the characters climb to move toward, the more contest happens. So the countries and the high tier individuals start contacting with each other. The bigger the challenges become and at the highest level, where basically the pre-God level, it becomes planet wide.

Here we would need to brainstorm what happens after he leaves the tunneler faction. Basically, what would be an interesting progression through territories. Where would he go, what kind of abilities he would develop, Like, how do we make an assassin story interesting and palatable? Typically it's only palatable when the guys he hunts are even worse.

So the whole thing should have this mystery slash mysticism vibes. Not because there is actual mysticism, though given the nature of the progression fantasy there can be. But I want this feel of hunting in the unknown. So maybe one interesting event would be characters escaping deeper into the mines, finding a natural cavern, for example, somewhere. maybe I don't know falling into an underground river and then that we will bring them somewhere where no other miner have been

There they can make like a contact with some entity which is against the mining but for some reason is not like against the character so they make tenuous contact. some kind of deal where the character helps to disrupt something with the mining operation in return for, I don't know, some power or help or whatever. So if we do that We would need to turn the perception of the mining operation into being harmful. Instead of just mining, we need to show that it actually hurts something important and relatable. So disrupting it would be worthwhile.

The whole operation needs to be big enough so like maybe at least hundreds of people, maybe thousands of people to fit in this mass destruction of the sub-faction of assholes that were hunting him. So we need to be able to kill out the whole faction and do like a hundred plus kills, if not more, without actually destroying the whole mining operation. So yeah I guess that faction would be doing something evil to the mines. Either way maybe they try to extract energy from that is actually hurting the whole network instead of just some crystals like the others did. So killing out this whole sub-faction of assholes that for hunting him would be perceived as a good thing to do.

So when he negotiates with that entity, the message would be something like that these crystals that are being mined are kind of the outer edge of this network. An analogy would be like hair, it grows but the edges kind of need to be trimmed and because they are dying out and those crystals that people mine are kind of these edges that the entity is fine with being removed. But the closer to the core they get and the more they find out a way to extract energy from the whole veins going underground – that actually hurts the entity and the network.

So when do they deal with the entities that propels the character to power the initial burst with to be able to dominate the mines. So basically the entity is very energy rich and that's where he gets his energy influx. However, that only accounts for the amounts of energy but it does not account for bringing him into the role of the class so we also need him like bridget that he got a bunch of energy but how does he turn that into the skill set since we can't abruptly just say that the system gives them him that.
