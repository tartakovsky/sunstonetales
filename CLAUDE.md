This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a children's therapeutic story creation project called "Seberiada" that develops structured narratives for ages 4-6. The project combines developmental psychology with storytelling to create emotionally supportive stories featuring the character Liska (a snow leopard cub) and friends.

## Auto-Read Instructions

**Before working on ANY story-related task, automatically read these core rule files:**

1. `context/core_rules/1_Core_Principles.md` - Foundational storytelling and developmental principles
2. `context/core_rules/2_Emotional_Framework.md` - Emotional regulation and metaphor guidelines
3. `context/core_rules/3_Developmental_Framework.md` - Age-appropriate developmental considerations
4. `context/core_rules/4_Structure_And_Style.md` - Story structure and prose formatting rules
5. `context/core_rules/5_Humor_And_Engagement.md` - Engagement and humor guidelines
6. `context/core_rules/6_Setting.md` - World-building and setting rules

**For character-specific work, also read:**
- `context/characters/Liska/liska_profile.md` - Main character profile
- Relevant character files from `context/characters/[CHARACTER]/` as needed

## Project Architecture

### Core Rules (context/core_rules/)
All fundamental project guidelines are consolidated in numbered files:
- Core principles, emotional frameworks, developmental guidelines
- Structure, style, humor, and setting rules
- **Always read these files before story work**

### Character System
Character profiles in `context/characters/[NAME]/`:
- `[name]_profile.md` - Basic character information
- `[name]_arcane.md` - Detailed psychological profile
- Special files for Liska: emotion regulation and coping strategy files

## File Organization

- `stories/[N]. [story_name]/` - Individual story development folders
- `stories/template_steps/` - Empty template files for new stories
- `context/core_rules/` - **Primary rules and guidelines**
- `context/characters/` - Character profiles and archetypes
- `marketing/` - Project marketing and branding materials

## Working with Stories

When creating or editing stories:

1. **FIRST**: Read all 6 core_rules files automatically
2. Follow the 6-step development process in order
3. Use character profiles for consistency
4. Ensure all content aligns with core principles and developmental framework
5. Apply proper structure and style guidelines

## Language Support

Project supports both English and Russian with language-specific formatting rules for dialogue and cultural adaptation requirements.
