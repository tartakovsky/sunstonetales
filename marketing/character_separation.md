# How To Handle Separate Character / Age Segments

## Liska Stories
- 4-6 yo audience
- NO character development between books
- She should always be a stable character with the same traits
- Only do developments inside a story
- Liska always stays 4-6 yo, we never age the characters
- When it's time to grow up she passes the baton to Arden & Cassia. They also never grow.

## Adventures of Arden & Cassia
- 7-9 yo audience. 
- Can do 2-3 book long stories where character learns and develops in one specific area
- They should always be stable characters with the same traits
