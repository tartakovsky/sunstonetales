This is a common and excellent problem to have. It means your core creative work—the writing—is strong. The bottleneck is production.

Here is a breakdown of what to do with your 20 text-only stories from both a parent's and a writer's perspective.

---

### 1. The Parent's Perspective: "How do I use text-only stories?"

A parent reading to their child doesn't see an "unfinished product." They see an opportunity for connection. You must reframe the text-only stories not as lacking pictures, but as offering something different and valuable.

**The "Problem" is Actually a Superpower: Imagination Fuel**

Without pictures, a child's brain is forced to do the work. This is a powerful developmental activity. Market and frame it this way.

*   **Activity 1: "Let's Be the Illustrator."**
    *   **How it works:** The parent reads one page (2-4 sentences). Then they pause and say, "What do you think that looks like? Let's draw it!" Keep a stack of paper and crayons nearby. By the end of the story, the parent and child have co-created their own, unique version of the book. This is an incredibly powerful bonding experience that a finished, illustrated book cannot offer.
    *   **Value:** It turns passive listening into active creation. It builds the child's imagination, confidence, and fine motor skills.

*   **Activity 2: "Imagination Movies."**
    *   **How it works:** This is perfect for bedtime or quiet time. The parent says, "We're going to listen to a story and make a movie of it in our heads. Close your eyes." The parent then reads the story with an expressive, gentle voice. After, they can ask, "What color was Liska's house in your movie? Was the sun shining?"
    *   **Value:** It's a screen-free, calming activity that develops visualization and listening comprehension skills, which are crucial for learning to read later.

*   **Activity 3: The Personal Audiobook.**
    *   **How it works:** The parent records themselves reading the 18 stories on their phone. They now have a personal, go-to playlist for car rides, travel, or quiet time when they can't actively read. The child is comforted by the familiar voice of their parent.
    *   **Value:** It's a high-quality, emotionally resonant alternative to screen time.

**Takeaway for a Parent:** A text-only story is not a deficit. It is a prompt for imagination, connection, and creativity.

### 2. The Writer's Perspective: "How do I sell my writing?"

You are in a much better position than you think. **Traditional publishers do not want illustrated manuscripts.** They want the text *only*, so they can pair it with an illustrator of their own choosing. Your 18 text-only stories are not "unfinished"; they are **"submission-ready manuscripts."**

Your 2 fully illustrated stories are your "proof of concept" and marketing tools.

**Path A: The Traditional Publishing Route**

1.  **The Asset:** You have 20 submission-ready picture book manuscripts. This is a fantastic portfolio.
2.  **The Action:**
    *   Polish your 3-5 strongest manuscripts. Ensure they are perfectly edited.
    *   Research literary agents who represent picture book authors.
    *   Write a professional query letter. In it, you can mention you have a series of 20 stories centered on the same character, which shows series potential—a huge plus for publishers.
    *   **Do not** submit your illustrations. Submit the text formatted as a professional manuscript. You are selling your skill as a *writer*.

**Path B: The Indie / Creator Route (Bypassing the Illustration Bottleneck)**

Illustrations are expensive. So, sell the text in a format where text is the primary product.

1.  **The Product: An Audio Series / Podcast.**
    *   **How it works:** Buy a decent microphone. Record yourself reading your 20 stories. Release one story per week as a free children's story podcast ("The Liska Stories," for example).
    *   **Monetization:** Once you have listeners, you can get sponsors, or use a platform like Patreon where parents can pay a small monthly fee for early access, bonus stories, or printable coloring pages based on the stories.
    *   **Advantage:** This builds a direct relationship with your audience (parents) who are hungry for this exact content.

2.  **The Product: A Paid Subscription Newsletter.**
    *   **How it works:** Use a platform like Substack or Patreon. The offer is simple: "A new, ready-to-read bedtime story delivered to your inbox twice a week for $5/month."
    *   **Why it works:** Parents are exhausted. They run out of stories. You are solving a real, recurring problem for them. You can include one of your illustrations as a header image to give it a professional feel.
    *   **Advantage:** Predictable, recurring revenue. You can build a business *today* without illustrating another page.

3.  **The Product: A Manuscript Portfolio for Freelancing.**
    *   **How it works:** Use your 20 stories as a portfolio to get work writing for children's apps, educational companies, YouTube channels, etc.
    *   **Advantage:** Leverages your proven skill to generate income that you can then use to commission illustrators for your own projects if you still want to.

### Strategic Path Forward

1.  **Immediate Action (Audience Building):** Start a podcast or a Substack *now*. Use your 18 text-only stories as the content. Use your 2 illustrated stories to create beautiful cover art and marketing materials for the project. This begins building your audience and validating your stories.

2.  **Medium-Term Action (Monetization):** As your audience grows, launch a Patreon or paid subscription tier. Offer the full "audiobook" of all 20 stories as a one-time purchase.

3.  **Long-Term Goal (Leverage):**
    *   **Option 1 (Traditional):** With a proven audience from your podcast, query agents. You can say, "I have a series of 20 stories, which has 10,000 monthly listeners on its podcast version." This makes you an incredibly attractive prospect.
    *   **Option 2 (Indie):** Use the income from your subscription/podcast to slowly commission a professional illustrator to work through your stories one by one. Self-publish them as you go, marketing them to the audience you have already built.

Your text is your most valuable asset. Stop thinking of it as half of a picture book and start thinking of it as a complete product in its own right—a script, a manuscript, an audio story.
