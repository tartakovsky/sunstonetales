### **Brand Identity & Strategy**

*   **Brand Name:** Sunstone Tales
*   **Core Identity:** A storytelling brand with psychological depth, not a psychologist's brand that tells stories.
*   **Primary Method:** Lead with storytelling, weaving in developmental psychology as the foundation that gives the stories power and efficacy.
- Positioning: You are not a psychologist who writes stories; you are a storyteller who understands psychology. You are positioned as a "storytelling studio" (like Pixar) that is intentional about child development.
- The "Why": The brand's purpose is to help parents create rituals of connection through story.

### **Content Execution**

*   **Posting Frequency:** At least one post per day.
*   **Content Pillars:**
    1.  **Story-First Psychology:** Discuss psychological issues through the lens of a storyteller. Use startling questions and insights into a child's feelings.
    2.  **Character Moments:** Use snippets (text + AI image) from existing or post-specific stories to show characters experiencing an emotion.
    3.  **Modeling Solutions:** Demonstrate how to help the characters, with the solution almost always being co-regulation and scaffolding.
*   **Asset Generation:** New, single-use content (e.g., one paragraph + one image) can be generated to cover any emotional theme, even without a finished book on that topic.

### **Lead Magnet Strategy**

*   **Name:** "The Emotional Foundation Guide" or similar.
*   **Content:** A high-value, standalone PDF focused purely on developmental psychology.
    *   Covers core emotions for the 4-6 year-old age range.
    *   Explains what is happening in the child's brain.
    *   Provides powerful reframes and simple scripts for parents.
*   **Strategic Purpose:**
    *   It captures the target audience's email by solving a direct psychological parenting problem.
    *   It establishes your authority and expertise independently of your stories.
    *   The stories are then positioned as the beautiful, practical *application* of the principles taught in the guide, creating a natural desire for the books.

### **Key Strategic Questions to Be Answered**

*   What is the tempo for changing the core emotional theme (e.g., one theme per week, per day)?
*   For a single theme covered by multiple posts, what is the specific framework for that sequence? From what angles should each post approach the emotion (e.g., Post 1: The startling question, Post 2: The child's physical sensation, Post 3: The parent's action)?
