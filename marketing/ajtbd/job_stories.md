### Stage 1: Book Selection Jobs

**Functional Jobs**

*   **When...** my child is facing a new or difficult social situation (like a friend moving away), **I want to...** find a book that accurately portrays and explains that specific scenario, **so I can...** give them a framework to understand and process their feelings.
*   **When...** I'm browsing for books online or in a store, **I want to...** be able to quickly determine if a book is appropriate for my child's specific cognitive and emotional level, **so I can...** avoid choosing something that is too babyish or too complex for them to grasp.
*   **When...** I'm choosing a book for tonight's reading, **I want to...** find one with a narrative and illustrations compelling enough to compete with my child's energy and distractions, **so I can...** ensure they will actually sit still and stay engaged.
*   **When...** I only have five minutes to pick a book before we leave the library, **I want to...** use reliable shortcuts like awards or trusted recommendations, **so I can...** efficiently vet the book's quality and make a confident choice under pressure.
*   **When...** I need to talk to my child about a sensitive topic (like lying or bullying), **I want to...** find a story that can serve as a gentle, indirect starting point, **so I can...** open a dialogue without making them feel accused or defensive.

**Emotional & Social Jobs**

*   **When...** I see other parents talking about the advanced books their kids are reading, **I want to...** find a book that is praised by developmental experts, **so I can...** feel confident and reassured that I am also providing the best resources for my child.
*   **When...** I successfully find a book that helps my child through a real-life problem, **I want to...** feel a sense of competence and resourcefulness, **so I can...** affirm my identity as a good parent who knows how to meet their child's needs.
*   **When...** I'm trying to understand why my child is acting a certain way, **I want to...** find a story that reflects their potential inner struggle, **so I can...** feel more empathetic and connected to their experience.
*   **When...** I'm in a social setting with other parents, **I want to...** be able to mention the thoughtful, development-focused books we are reading, **so I can...** be perceived as an informed and dedicated parent.

### Stage 2: The Reading Session Jobs

**Functional Jobs**

*   **When...** it's 8 PM, I'm exhausted, and my child is refusing to settle down, **I want to...** just get through the story without a major meltdown, **so I can...** check the "read a story" box for the day and move on to bedtime.
*   **When...** my child is constantly wiggling, interrupting, or trying to leave, **I want to...** use my voice, the illustrations, and physical closeness to hold their focus, **so I can...** actually make progress through the narrative.
*   **When...** my child is hyperactive before bed, **I want to...** use a calm, rhythmic reading voice, **so I can...** help regulate their energy down and prepare them for sleep.
*   **When...** my child asks an off-topic question for the fifth time, **I want to...** quickly acknowledge it without losing my place or the story's momentum, **so I can...** respect their curiosity while still fulfilling the goal of finishing the book.

**Emotional & Social Jobs**

*   **When...** I feel my patience wearing thin during a difficult reading session, **I want to...** manage my own frustration and maintain a calm exterior, **so I can...** feel that I am being the patient, loving parent I aspire to be.
*   **When...** the day has been chaotic and I've barely had a positive moment with my child, **I want to...** use story time as a guaranteed moment of physical closeness and shared attention, **so I can...** end the day feeling connected and reaffirm our bond.
*   **When...** my child says something insightful or kind in response to the story, **I want to...** make a mental note of it, **so I can...** have a positive anecdote to hold onto and share with my partner, reinforcing that our efforts are working.
*   **When...** I talk to other parents about our daily routine, **I want to...** be able to honestly say that we read together every night, **so I can...** maintain my social identity as a parent who values and prioritizes reading.

### Stage 3: Post-Reading Jobs

**Functional Jobs**

*   **When...** we close a book with a clear moral, **I want to...** ask one simple question like "Why was the fox a good friend?", **so I can...** quickly gauge if the core lesson was actually understood.
*   **When...** we finish a story about a specific behavior, like sharing, **I want to...** explicitly say, "That's what we can do, too!", **so I can...** create a memorable "mental hook" that I can easily reference in a future real-life situation.
*   **When...** my child seems to have grasped the story's concept, **I want to...** connect it to a real event in their own life, like "Remember when you shared your snack at the park?", **so I can...** help them translate the abstract idea into their concrete reality.
*   **When...** I see my child apply a lesson from a book in the real world (e.g., they comfort a friend), **I want to...** explicitly praise them by referencing the story, **so I can...** reinforce the desired behavior and the value of the book.

**Emotional & Social Jobs**

*   **When...** my child gives a thoughtful answer about the story's meaning, **I want to...** feel a surge of pride and reassurance, **so I can...** believe that the time and effort I'm investing in reading is having a tangible, positive impact.
*   **When...** we have a good conversation after a book, **I want to...** feel that I have successfully "taught" a valuable lesson, **so I can...** fulfill my role as a guide and feel effective in my parenting.
*   **When...** my child does something kind and I can trace it back to a book we read, **I want to...** have a concrete success story to share with my partner or a grandparent, **so I can...** receive validation for my parenting approach and share in the pride of my child's development.
