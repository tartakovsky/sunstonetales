Job Stories for The "Emotionally-Attuned" Parent


Job Story 1: Navigating Big Feelings
* When my child is overwhelmed by a big, scary emotion like anger or frustration and I struggle
    to explain it to them in the moment,
* I want to find a story that gives the emotion a name and a face, showing a character who feels
    the same way,
* so we can have a shared, simple language to talk about what’s happening inside them and a
    strategy to work through it together.


Job Story 2: Building Empathy
* When my child snatches a toy or says something that makes another person sad, and they don't
    grasp the consequences of their actions,
* I want to use a story to show them how a character’s actions made someone else feel,
* so they can begin to connect their behavior to others' emotions and learn to see things from
    another's point of view.


Job Story 3: Overcoming Fear
* When a new fear (like the dark, monsters, or going to the doctor) is causing my child real
    distress and I can't just reason it away,
* I want to read them an engaging story about a character who confronts and overcomes that
    exact same fear,
* so they can feel understood, borrow the character's courage, and have a tangible strategy
    from the story to feel brave.

High-Level vs. Specific Job Stories

The job stories I provided are high-level job stories.

They describe the primary, overarching progress that the "Emotionally-Attuned Parent" wants to
make. They are the main "why" behind hiring a storybook.

Specific, lower-level jobs would be the smaller tasks they have to do to accomplish that main
job. For example:


* When I've identified my child is struggling with jealousy, I want to find a book that deals
    with that specific theme, so I can be sure the story is relevant to our current problem.
* When it's time to read, I want to get my child to calm down and sit with me, so they are
    receptive to hearing the story's message.
* When the story is over, I want to ask a few simple questions about the character's feelings,
    so I can check if my child understood the lesson.


What Are Job Graphs?

A Job Graph is the hierarchy of all the jobs (high-level and low-level) that a person must
perform to achieve their ultimate goal with a specific solution. It's a map of the entire
process, from start to finish.


The goal of creating a great product is to simplify the job graph—to eliminate or automate as
many of the lower-level jobs as possible, making it easier for the user to achieve their
high-level job.

Let's map out a simplified Job Graph for the "Overcoming Fear" story:


High-Level Job: Help my child overcome their fear of the dark.


Job Graph (The sequence of lower-level jobs):
1. Recognize the need: "I need to find a way to help my child with this fear."
2. Search for solutions: "I'll search online for 'children's books about being afraid of the
    dark'."
3. Evaluate options: "I'll read reviews and look at the pictures to see which book looks best."
4. Acquire the solution: "I'll buy the book."
5. Prepare for the job: "I'll make it part of our calm bedtime routine."
6. Execute the core job: "I'll read the story in an engaging voice."
7. Reinforce the outcome: "I'll talk about the brave character when my child is scared later."

Low-level jobs examples:

# Lower-Level Job Stories & Problems

Looks very good to handle the issues in 1-page preface. Then there will be similar jobs for each problematic emotion and social situation. Probably good to research each for each book and handle them in the preface (also validate that book content is appropriate)

Phase 1: Diagnosis & Search


* When my child is crying about a "monster" but I can't tell if the real fear is being alone, a
    specific shadow, or a noise they heard,
* I want to accurately pinpoint the root cause of their fear,
* so I can find a solution that addresses the actual problem instead of just the symptom.


* When I search online for "books for kids afraid of the dark" and get thousands of
    overwhelming results,
* I want to quickly filter through the noise and find a few high-quality, relevant options,
* so I don't waste an hour of my limited free time on analysis paralysis.

Phase 2: Evaluation & Selection


* When I'm looking at a book online that says it's for "ages 3-7,"
* I want to know if the story's message and complexity are truly right for my 4-year-old's
    developmental stage,
* so I can avoid buying a book that either confuses them or bores them.


* When I'm trying to choose a book to help with fear,
* I want to be sure its core message validates my child's feelings instead of dismissing them,
* so I can reinforce my parenting approach of empathy and empowerment, not shame.


* When I'm buying a book about a "friendly" monster to ease my child's fear,
* I want to see the key illustrations beforehand,
* so I can be certain the art style isn't accidentally terrifying and won't make the fear
    worse.


Phase 3: Execution & Reinforcement


* When my child is already scared and crying at bedtime,
* I want to have a way to calm them down before reading the story,
* so they are actually in a state where they can listen and absorb the message.


* When we finish reading the story about the brave character,
* I want to have a simple, natural way to connect the story to my child's own bedroom and
    feelings,
* so the lesson becomes a concrete tool they can use, not just an abstract idea.


* When my child wakes up scared in the middle of the night,
* I want to instantly recall the specific coping strategy from the story,
* so I can consistently reinforce the lesson and help them build a real habit of bravery.

The specific emotion or social situation (fear, anger,
  jealousy, not sharing, being a sore loser) is just a variable. The parent's underlying job graph
  remains remarkably consistent for each one.


  For almost any emotional or social challenge, the parent will have to perform the same
  sequence of lower-level jobs:


   1. Diagnose: "When I see my child struggling with [Emotion X], I want to understand the root
      cause, so I can find the right approach."
   2. Search & Select: "When I need a tool for [Emotion X], I want to find a high-quality,
      age-appropriate story that matches my values, so I don't waste time or make the problem
      worse."
   3. Execute: "When my child is in the middle of [Situation Y], I want to deploy the story in a
      way that they are receptive to, so the lesson actually lands."
   4. Reinforce: "When [Situation Y] happens again, I want to remember and apply the story's
      language and tools, so the learning becomes a durable skill."


  The problems they face—overwhelm, vetting content, bad timing, and forgetting to follow
  through—are also the same in every case.
