# Reel: Why "don't be afraid" backfires

## Captions
- Never say "don't be afraid"
- You're telling them their feelings are bad
- So they learn "I am bad"
- Instead, hug and say:
- "You feel scared. It's okay to be scared."
- "I'm right here with you."
- They need you to accept them before they can accept themselves.

## Animation Sequence
- 0-3s: An illustrated child looks nervously at a shadow. A parent figure stands above them with a "stop" hand gesture.
- 3-6s: The child's posture droops. A thought bubble appears over their head with their face crossed over.
- 7-9s: Scene resets. The parent is now kneeling down to the child's level with soft, open arms.
- 9-12s: The parent and child are in a gentle hug. The child is listening as the parent speaks.
- 12-15s: The final image holds on the hug. The child looks calm and secure. A soft, warm glow animates around them.
