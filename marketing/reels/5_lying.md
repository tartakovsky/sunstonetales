# Reel: Your 5-year-old Doesn't Lie Maliciously.

## Captions
- Your 5-year-old doesn't lie maliciously.
- They're problem-solving with limited tools.
- They're afraid of shame or punishment.
- Or testing boundaries.
- Or trying to get what they want.
- Punishing them for a lie teaches them to lie better.
- And that you are not on their side.
- Instead:
- Promise that truth will not be punished or blamed.
- Ask what they wanted to achieve.
- Be on their side. Solve the problem together.

## Animation Sequence
1.  A child stands over a broken cookie jar, looking scared.
2.  A parent enters with an angry expression. The child defensively spreads their hands to the sides, shrugging, shakes their head, visually saying "I didn't do it."
3.  The parent figure is standing over the child, pointing a finger in a scolding way. A red cross appears in the corner of the frame.
4.  The frame transitions. The parent is now kneeling with a soft, accepting expression. A green checkmark appears in the corner.
5.  The parent puts a comforting arm around the child's shoulder and gestures with an open, curious hand towards a high shelf with a new cookie jar.
6.  The parent pushes a small stool towards the jar. The child climbs on it and happily reaches for a cookie, looking safe, happy, and connected with the parent.
