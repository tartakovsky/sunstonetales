# Reel: 5-Year-Olds Can't Think During a Meltdown

## Captions
- 5-year-olds can't think during a meltdown.
- Their reasoning literally shuts down.
- They can't perceive explanations. 
- So what do you do?
- Be with them. Support them. Validate their emotions.
- Explain and solve only *after* they calm down.

## Animation Sequence
1.  An illustration shows a child having a meltdown. Above their head, the word "Thinking" is crossed out, while the word "FEELING" is heavily underlined and glowing red.
2.  A parent figure enters and a speech bubble with "You shouldn't..." appears, moving toward the child.
3.  The speech bubble hits an invisible barrier around the child and shatters.
4.  The parent figure stops talking, gets down to the child's level, and a new speech bubble appears with a heart inside.
5.  The child is now calm. Above their head, both "Thinking" and "Feeling" are clearly underlined, showing they are integrated.
6.  The parent and child are talking calmly, with a shared speech bubble between them.
