# Reel: 3 Things NOT To Do When Your Child Melts Down

## Captions
- When your child melts down
- Don't rush to fix it. This teaches them "My feelings don't matter. Problem does."
- Don't say "Calm down!". That teaches them "It's bad to feel."
- Don't walk away. This teaches them "My biggest feelings push love away."

- Instead?
- Stay calm. Tell them what they feel. That it's okay to feel that way.
- That helps them accept themselves.

## Animation Sequence
1. An illustrated child is crying on the floor next to a toy castle that has fallen over.
2. A parent figure rushes in, ignoring the child, and quickly reassembles the toy castle. The child continues crying.
3. The parent figure stands over the child with a stern face and a speech bubble saying "Calm down!". The child looks smaller and cries harder.
4. The parent figure turns and walks out of the frame, leaving the child alone and crying next to the fixed castle.
5. The parent figure re-enters the frame, kneels down with a soft expression and open arms. The crying child looks up, surprised.
6. The parent figure is now hugging the crying child, who is still holding the broken toy. The parent has a kind, gentle smile.
7. The child has stopped crying, snuggles into the parent's hug, and looks up at them with a connected, loving expression.
