# Psychological Review (Stricter Analysis)

### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere
Text:
> The Sarabád market was a whirlwind of smells—melons, fish, camels—and a river of sounds from vendors, carts, and goats. Liska's tail swished like a happy rudder as she navigated the chaotic, wonderful flood of sensations.

*   **Critique**: While functional, the description is generic. It describes the market from a narrator's perspective, not Liska's. The experience of a small child in a "chaotic, wonderful flood" is unique. Is it wonderful because of the variety, or is it teetering on overwhelming from the start?
*   **Suggestion**: Ground the description more firmly in Liska's perspective. Instead of a list, connect the sensations to her actions. For example: "Liska's nose twitched, trying to follow the scent of sweet melon past the sharp smell of fish. A goat bleated right in her ear, and she jumped, her tail flicking from a happy rudder to a startled question mark before settling again." This introduces a subtle hint of the market's potential to overwhelm.

### Beat 4.3: The Turning Point
Text:
> But then she looked at her paw, still touching the apron, staring at it to make sure it was being brave. *No more mouse*, she thought. She took a deep breath, made her paw into a determined fist, and gave two firm *TUG, TUG*s. The Kebab-Man stopped shouting and looked down. He saw a tiny, trembling paw holding fast to his apron. "Oh!" he boomed softly, kneeling. He scooped Liska up and sat her on a tall stool next to his stall, a safe island out of the river of legs. "There now, little one. You look a bit lost." He passed her a small piece of warm bread and waited while she took a shaky nibble. "I know just the person to help," said the Kebab-Man. "Guard Omar is the best finder in all of Sarabád."

*   **Critique**: The Kebab-Man's response is overly idealized. He is a perfect co-regulator, which diminishes narrative tension and Liska's role in the solution. Per the user rules, co-regulation during high tension should be minimal to avoid premature conflict resolution. Giving her bread, moving her, and immediately having the perfect solution outsources the problem-solving away from Liska.
*   **Suggestion**: Make the helper less perfect. When the Kebab-Man sees her, he could be flustered. "Little one! Where did you come from? Are you lost?" This puts the onus back on Liska. She has to use her words, however small, to articulate her need. Instead of him suggesting the guard, perhaps she has to say "Papa said... find a helper." This forces her to be an active agent in her rescue, not just a passive recipient of perfect help.
