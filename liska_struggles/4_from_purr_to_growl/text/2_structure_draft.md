# Story Structure: From Purr to Growl

## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere
The garden was bathed in dawn light, the sky turning pink and the air smelling of fresh dew. Liska drew a gift for her mother, purring loudly with joy, her tail swaying happily. She stuck out her tongue in adorable effort, focusing intensely on her art with a small smile, her spotted fur catching the soft dawn light as she hummed contentedly over her childlike drawing of her family.

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
A rustle came from the bushes, followed by a loud yowl of excitement, and then Anji sprinted out. He ran up from behind Liska, touched her on the shoulder and asked what she was doing. 

We need a dialogue here for Anji. "Ooh, you're drawing! Let's draw together!".

His boundless energy broke the quiet garden moment, tail twitching with eagerness, as Liska looked back startled with a funny, wide-eyed expression.

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
Liska startled at Anji's sudden approach, her body tensing with a small jump. Anji, without waiting for a response, reached right past her for the red marker, but in his haste, his paw bumped the water cup. Splash! A big puddle spread across Liska's picture, surprising even himself as he froze for a moment with the marker still in paw.

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
Liska froze as water ruined her drawing, feeling her face get hot with a burning sensation, her tail shooting straight up and puffing out as she stared at the ruined drawing with big, shocked eyes. The violation of her space and the sight of her ruined gift for mother hit her like a wave of heat through her body.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)
Liska growled at Anji, her voice sharp and trembling with indignation over the boundary violation, and swiped with a paw to push him back. In her fury, she accidentally tore her drawing in the process.

### Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)
Liska ran to Father crying out, 'PAPA MY DRAWING IS RUINED!', clutching the torn picture with trembling paws, tears streaming down her spotted cheeks. Her face remained hot as she struggled with the violation of her space, the distress after the ruined drawing making her cry out louder, her tail drooping as she sought comfort from the overwhelming emotion.

### Beat 3.3: Recovery
<!-- 
- this paragraph needs to be a lot shorter 
- somewhere they should ask the question "what happened?" We're missing the point where she blames Anji before asking to tell him to never do it again
-->

<!-- In practice, the sequence is very fast and fluid:
Liska runs in crying.
Immediate action: Father scoops her into a hug.
Immediate words (Connect): "Whoa, you are so upset! I've got you."
(Liska's crying might peak and then start to quiet slightly in the safety of the hug).
A few seconds later (Redirect): "Okay... can you tell me what happened?"
 -->
Father hugged Liska tightly, maintaining a calm presence. He connected at eye level with a soft voice, noted "you are mad", validated her feelings with "It's okay to be so mad about this," and listened. Mother joined for additional co-regulation, hugging Liska warmly with a tender embrace. She whispered gently, 'It's okay to feel upset, my little snowflake,' sitting close as Liska's sobs began to quiet, her body slowly relaxing into the comfort. They stayed with her until the burning feeling in her face started to cool and her breathing became more steady. Liska, still sniffling, asked Father to tell Anji never-never to do that again, her voice pleading as she clutched his fur.

### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation
<!-- 
Here it's didactic and not enough agency. 
They just force the solution on her.
How should they go about it instead. 
1) Let's find a way
2) Asking a leading question? E.g. "what happened when he spilled your water?" "I got mad and swiped at him!" 

But isn't it too late psychologically to try and contain the situation whe is already indignant? Is it even possible for a child to self-regulate when she feels that? 

If not, what do we do? We model it anyway? We teach something else?

Assuming we proceed as is, a question exchange might be:
"What would you think make Anji stop taking your things and making you angry?"
"Hmm... Maybe if I just ask him to stop?"
"Great idea! Do you think you can ask him to stop when you're that angry?"
"No..."
"Indeed. Then I think we need to give you a way to calm down and then you can ask him to stop."
"How do I do that?"
"Very simple. Just take a breath. When you feel hot and want to should, try pausing for a tiny second and take a breath. And then try to tell him to stop.
"I'm not sure I can do that!"
"Let's play it out then?"

---


 -->

 <!-- We start with that -->
 Father: "You're right, he shouldn't just grab your things. We need to make sure he asks." Liska nodded, sniffling.

Father: "What happened after you felt so angry and hot in your face?"

Liska: "I growled and... I swiped at him! And then my drawing tore!"

Father: "Hmm. So the growl didn't work. How can we stop him from grabbing your things?.."

Liska: "Maybe... I just ask him to stop?"

Father: "Right! I think you'll need a superpower for that!"

Liska, eyes big: "Superpower?"

Father quickly does SNIFF, PUFF: "The flower-soup breath! Sniff in, puff out...
<!-- Discuss further -->

<!-- something in between -->

<!-- Practice with mother. Maybe it's not her who grabs the toy, but a plush toy comes to grab a crayon from Slothy, so it's less emotionally hard for Liska. -->
Mother: (Smiling, bringing over a plush Slothy and a toy monkey) "Let's play. Slothy is drawing, and here comes Cheeky Monkey to grab his crayon!" (She makes the monkey reach). "Quick, Slothy! What's the superpower?"

Liska: (Takes a big, puffing breath, then makes Slothy hold up a paw. In a small, firm voice, she says) "Stop. Please ask first."

Mother: (As the monkey, pulling its paw back in surprise) "Oh! Okay."
Liska: (Giggles, her tail giving a happy flick) "It worked!"

<!-- outdated -->
Father gently guided with 'Let's find a way for you to tell Anji.' He introduced 'Spot' - noticing when her body felt hot and angry - and 'Stop' - taking deep 'Snow Leopard Breaths' to cool the wildfire inside. Mother and Liska roleplayed with toys under the pergola. Mother introduced 'Shift' as a boundary phrase, saying with a smile, 'Just say, "Please ask first."' They acted out a scene with plush snow leopard and other cat toys. Liska succeeded at 'Stop,' taking deep 'Snow Leopard Breaths' with a determined little puff, her chest rising and falling more steadily. She nodded with determination, raising the plush's paw up and saying 'Stop!' to the other toys in a small but firm voice, practicing how to protect her space in a playful, safe setting, her tail flicking with growing confidence.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt
Liska returned to the drawing table in the garden the next day, sneaking comically with high steps, her spotted tail swaying cautiously as she looked warily around for Anji with comically exaggerated furtive glances, her eyes wide and ears perked. Anji bounced in excitedly, yowling with his usual boundless energy, his cream fur with brown points catching the light, and reached for Liska's paints again without asking.

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback
Liska felt familiar emotional signals, her face heating up with indignation as the familiar burn crept into her cheeks, and noticed them "I feel hot!" Her tail puffed up and stiffened as tension rolled in from the potential boundary violation, her heart beating faster while she gripped the edge of the table, the memory of the ruined drawing flashing in her mind.

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested -> Learned Skill -> Persistence
Liska remembers "Just take a breath". Her chest rising slowly as she inhaled like smelling a mountain flower, and fell down as she exhaled like cooling a soup. She stood,raising a paw hesitantly but with resolve, her voice a little shaky but clear, 'Stop!' as she looked directly at him, her tail still puffed but her stance firm with newfound determination.

### Beat 4.4: Success
Anji blinked in surprise, his eyes wide, ears twitching back as he pulled his paw away from the paints. Liska then establishes the boundary, 'It's my drawing. You must ask for permission,' her voice steadier now. Shocked by her command, he hesitated, his tail flicking uncertainly, then yowled softly with a sheepish look, 'Can I draw too?' showing a shift in his behavior as he respected her space for the first time.

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief
Liska felt tension leave her body, her face cooling down as the burning sensation faded. She nodded gently, 'Okay, let's draw.' Anji let out a happy yip. 'Hooray!' A small smile broke through on Liska's face, her tail relaxing and swaying slightly, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. She however then feels the need to re-iterate her control and tells him something along the lines of "But (you can only do something that something way)"

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning
Liska and Anji drew together at the small table in the garden, side by side under the morning sun, with Anji being careful for once, pausing to yowl softly for permission before reaching for a crayon. 'Can I use this color?' he asked with a bouncy little tilt of his head. Liska nodded with a contented purr. She wiggled with a giggle, thinking how breathing had made her feel like a mighty snow leopard, strong and calm. She puffed out her chest playfully, catching Anji's curious glance, and chirped to herself, "I can handle anything now!" her eyes bright with her secret power.

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo
They worked toward two gifts for Liska's mother, their small table covered in colorful strokes under the dawn-lit pergola. They smiled at each other, sharing colors to make beautiful art together, tails swaying in sync with a gentle rhythm. After finishing, Anji snatched a stray leaf and darted off, yowling, "Catch me if you can!" Liska laughed with a delighted chirp, chasing him around the garden table, her tail bouncing. They tumbled together in a giggling heap after she tagged him, rebuilding trust through this lively game, their friendship visibly stronger as conflict melted into shared fun.

### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
The garden echoed with their quiet, friendly purring, signaling harmony as they sat close, smiling while their purrs blended in the peaceful morning air. Liska looked at their finished drawings, thinking happily how she had learned to establish her boundaries and still keep her friend. She felt proud, and her heart was light with the joy of a mended bond.
