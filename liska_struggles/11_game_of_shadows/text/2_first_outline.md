### How Liska Was Afraid of the Dark

<!-- It's good -->

### **Act 1: Introduction**

*   **1.1: Setting and Atmosphere:**
    *   Earlier that day, Liska had helped Mara move a big, leafy plant into her room. It had wide leaves with funny holes in them, and they'd decided it looked like a friendly jungle monster. The room feels cheerful and green.
    
*   **1.2: Character Introduction:**
    *   Now, it's night. Liska, a little snow leopard, is curled up in her bed, her breathing soft and even. Her sloth, a soft, floppy toy, is tucked under her arm. A tiny, happy purr rumbles in her chest.

### **Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins**

*   **2.2: The Catalyst:**
    *   Her mother, Mara, comes in to give her a final goodnight kiss and leaves the room.

*   **2.3: The Core Incident:**
    *   In the shifting moonlight, the plant's shadow looms large and unfamiliar. The leaves become spiky fingers, and the stems look like long, wobbly legs.
    *   **Slot:** `Emotional Trigger: Scary/Threatening`

*   **2.4: Fallout:**
    *   Liska’s heart thumps. She feels like a **`Little Mouse`**, tiny and scared. She scrambles from her bed and runs to her mother.
    *   **Slot:** `Emotion Group: Fear / Anxiety`
    *   **Slot:** `Dysregulation: With Parent - High Distress`

### **Act 3: Attempts to Solve / Unravel – Facing the Problem**

*   **3.1: Recovery:**
    *   Mara meets her with a hug, holding her close and rocking her gently until Liska’s thumping heart begins to slow. "It's big and it has arms!" Liska whispers into her shoulder. Mara holds her for another moment, then says softly, "I see you're scared. That's a big feeling, and it's okay. Let's try our brave words: *I am safe. This is my room.*"

    *   Mara says, "An explorer often needs a brave companion. Would you like to take someone with you?" Liska nods, grabbing the sloth. As they walk back, Mara adds, "And explorers have a plan. Remember our Brave Explorer Plan? First, we **notice** what our body feels. Then, we **pause** to take a breath. Then, we find a way to **help**." Back in the room, Mara lights a candle, revealing the familiar plant in its pot. Liska is still wary, but the immediate fear subsides.

*   **3.4: Low Point (Confronting Fear Alone):**
    *   The following night, Mara tucks her in and leaves. Liska is alone with the sloth. The familiar, silent shadow of the plant looms in the corner. Wind ruffles the leafs and the plant becomes even scarier. Though she *knows* it's just the plant, the `Little Mouse` feeling creeps back in. She feels overwhelmed and alone.
    *   **Slot:** `Dysregulation: Alone - Moderate Distress`

    *   **Slot:** `Solution Discovery Process: Memory Scaffolding`

### **Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Internally**

*   **4.1: Final Attempt:**
    *   Clutching her sloth, Liska swings her legs out of bed.
    
*   **4.2: Rising Tension:**
    *   She stands, hesitating. Her paws feel frozen to the floor. They wouldn't move. The shadow seems to grow bigger in the quiet room.

*   **4.3: The Turning Point (Notice, Pause, Help):**
    *   She remembered the Brave Explorer Plan. *My heart is beating like a little mouse,* she noticed. She paused and took a shaky breath. "I need help," she thought. She looked down at the sloth in her arms, its button eyes looking back at her. She hugged it, a small, fierce hug. The soft, familiar toy made her feel safer. "I'm safe. I'm brave. We already did that before," she whispered. This gave her the final push.
    
*   **4.4: Success:**
    *   She scurries across the room, hugging her sloth. She stands in front of the plant. She takes her sloth, stretches it's paw toward the plant and touches the shadow with it's paw. It's a broad, smooth leaf. It's just the plant.

*   **4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief:**
    *   A wave of relief and pride washes over her. The `Little Mouse` feeling was still there, but a bigger, warmer feeling of accomplishment took its place.
    *   **Slot:** `Emotion Group: Pride / Confidence`

### **Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth**

*   **5.1: Relaxation / Immediate Aftermath:**
    *   She gives the plant's leaf a little pat, then scurries back to bed, hugging her sloth. She feels tired, but proud and safe.
    
*   **5.2: Reflection & Learning:**
    *   The next morning, she tells Mara, "I was a brave explorer last night. The sloth and I went on an adventure."
    *   **Slot:** `Support: Process Praise` (Mara smiles. "You felt scared, and you still went to look. That's what brave explorers do.")
    
*   **5.4: New Status Quo:**
    *   A few nights later, we see Liska in bed. Before falling asleep, she takes her sloth and makes its shadow dance on the wall for a moment. They are no longer scary; they are her playmates.
    
*   **5.5: Concluding Thought:**
    *   And Liska knew that even when shadows danced in her room, she and her sloth could always play together with them.
