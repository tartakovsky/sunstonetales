---

## Act 1: Introduction – Normal Life

### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere
The night before camp. Liska bounces around her room, too excited to sleep. "Tomorrow I go to camp! I'll swim in the big lake! I'll catch fireflies!"
She practices her camp song, making up silly verses. Everything feels like an adventure waiting to happen.

### Beat 1.2: Introduce character(s)
Mara tucks her in. "Sleep well, my little explorer. Tomorrow is your big day."
Liska wiggles under her blanket, boasting to her mom, "I'm going to be the best tree climber there!" 
She falls asleep dreaming of all the fun waiting for her.

## Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
Morning. Time to pack. Liska's overnight bag sits open on the floor.
She puts in her swimming clothes. Then her favorite toy. Takes it out. Slowly puts it back in. Slowly takes it out again. Her ears droop. 
She stares at the bag. Tonight she won't be here. Tonight she'll be... somewhere else.

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
Mara enters, sees Liska sitting very still, just staring at her half-packed bag.
She sits down beside her daughter. "What is it, kitten?"
Liska's voice comes out tiny: "The 'overnight' part means... I have to sleep there alone?"

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
Liska throws herself into her mother's arms, crying out, "I don't want to go without you!"

### Beat 2.4: Fallout
Liska's shoulders droop as quiet sobs shake her body. Her throat is tight and her eyes feel hot. Mara holds her, and a tear from Mara's own eye lands on Liska's fur. Liska thinks: "Mama is crying too!"

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve

### Beat 3.1: Recovery
Mara rocks Liska gently. "I want to tell you a story," she says.
"Before you were born, we took care of a little white fox. When you were born, you were a tiny ball of white fur, just like him. So we named you Liska. It means 'little fox.'"
"The fox grew bigger. One day, he wanted to go explore the forest. We felt sad when he left." Mara's eyes get a little wet. "But we also felt excited for him. Sad and excited at the same time. Because he was going on an adventure! And you're going on an adventure too."
Mara pulls out a tiny, soft tuft of white fur on a string. 
"I saved it from your own baby fur," she says, tying it gently around Liska's neck. "I saved it because I love you so much. When you hold it, you can feel my love. Even when I'm not there."

### Beat 3.2: Attempt 1
After the story, Liska wipes her tears. She stands up and grabs her bag. Her legs feel shaky. She takes two steps, but her body turns back all by itself and she runs to hug her mother's leg.
Mara kneels down. "We can be sad and still walk." 
Together, holding paws, they walk to the door. This time, Liska's other paw is clutching the tuft.

### Beat 3.3: Attempt 2
<!-- That's too much tell and no show -->

At camp, Liska has fun! She splashes in the lake. She sings silly songs. She catches three frogs.
But as the sun sets, the happy feelings drain away. The missing-Mama feelings come back, stronger than before.

### Beat 3.4: Low Point
<!-- needs a bit more tell -->
Bedtime. The tent smells wrong. No soft scratch of Mama's goodnight lick. No Papa's bedtime story.
Her throat hurts. Her eyes sting. She clutches the tuft and curls into a tight ball under her blanket.
She cries silently, trying not to wake the other cubs.

### Beat 3.5: Recovery
She's crying silently when her paw brushes the tuft on her neck.
- **NOTICE:** "My chest feels all tight. My throat hurts." Her paw finds the familiar soft fur.
- **PAUSE:** She stops crying for a second. She remembers Mama's voice telling the fox story.
- **HELP:** She clutches the tuft. She whispers to it, "Sad... excited." She takes one shaky breath. Then another. The tight feeling in her chest gets a little looser.
<!-- yes, but not a bullet list, a narrative. Also there is no mama's love and remembering the fox -->

### Beat 3.6: Re-evaluation
The crying has stopped. The ache is still there, but it's not so huge anymore. Through her teary eyes, she sees moonlight on the tent wall. She remembers something: At home, she and Mama always say goodnight to the moon together. A new thought forms, simple and clear: "Mama can see the moon. If I see the moon, it's like we are seeing it together."

## Act 4: Climax & Solution

### Beat 4.1: Final Attempt
She chooses to act. She slowly, deliberately, uncurls from her tight ball.

### Beat 4.2: Rising Tension
She creeps silently to the flap of the tent. A twig snaps outside. An owl hoots. Every shadow is unfamiliar. Her heart thumps. She almost turns back.
<!-- what is she afraid of? She's lonely, not afraid -->

### Beat 4.3: Turning Point
She hesitates at the opening, the lonely feeling washing over her again. She squeezes the tuft, takes one more shaky breath, and pushes the flap aside.
<!-- Why she hesitates? -->

### Beat 4.4: Success (A Familiar Sight)
There it is. The big, bright moon, just like at home.
She holds up the tuft. "Hi Mama," she whispers to the moon. "I'm 
being sad and excited. Like the fox."

### Beat 4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief (A Bubble of Excitement)

Another cub comes out and sits nearby, also looking at the moon. 
"Can't sleep either? I miss my family too," the cub says. Liska isn't the only one.

## Act 5: Resolution

### Beat 5.1: Catharsis
"Want to build a secret fort tomorrow?" the new friend whispers. "My sister taught me how."
They sit together in the moonlight, whispering about their plans. The heavy, lonely feeling in Liska's chest finally floats away.

### Beat 5.2: Reflection & Learning
The next morning, Liska is showing her new friend the best sticks for a fort. When another camper says they felt sad last night, Liska says, "Me too! Then I looked at the moon and found a friend." She touches her tuft, a small, secret smile on her face.

### Beat 5.3: Integration
Next evening, running into Mama's arms. So many stories to tell! "I was sad AND excited, just like the fox! And I made a friend! And we built a fort!"

### Beat 5.4: New Normal
That night, safe in her den, Liska carefully places the tuft next to a special stick from her new friend.
She snuggles under her heavy quilt. "Mama?"
"Yes, kitten?"
"Camp was fun."

### Beat 5.5: Concluding Thought / Wrap-up
The tuft reminds her: Mama loves me. And it's okay to feel two things at once.
