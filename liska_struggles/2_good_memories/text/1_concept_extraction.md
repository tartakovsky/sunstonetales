## Goal of the Story

This story addresses the cognitive tendency toward negativity bias—how negative experiences naturally dominate our attention and memory while positive moments require deliberate effort to recall and savor. We're teaching the reader that while difficult emotions like anger come automatically and feel overwhelming, joy and positive memories are equally real but need to be actively sought out, like treasures on a beach. The problem we're addressing is getting stuck in negative emotional states after disappointment, unable to access the positive aspects of an experience. Our solution offers a two-step approach: first, physical release techniques to "cool down" intense emotions (the volcano metaphor), and second, the deliberate practice of searching for positive memories once the emotional intensity has lowered. We present this through a relatable scenario of a ruined sandcastle because it perfectly captures how a single negative event can overshadow an entire positive experience, teaching children that they have agency in what they choose to remember and focus on.

## Synopsis

Liska and her friend Anji spend a day at the beach building a sandcastle. Despite having fun moments—seeing a funny crab, making creative decorations—their castle is suddenly destroyed when a seagull lands on it. While walking home, Anji happily recalls the fun they had, but Liska can only focus on the destroyed castle. When Anji asks why she doesn't want to remember the good parts, Liska becomes confused and upset.

At home, Liska's mother validates her anger using the "little volcano" metaphor, explaining how anger "bubbles and burns" inside. She teaches Liska to stomp and roar like a snow leopard to help the volcano cool down. When this only partially works, her mother explains that sad feelings are often stronger than happy ones and come automatically, while happy memories are like shells on the beach—they need to be actively searched for as treasures.

The next day, when another creation (a crab garden) is destroyed by a wave, Liska feels the volcano rising again. She uses the stomping and roaring technique, and when Anji's humorous reaction to the wave makes her laugh, she notices the volcano has calmed. She then deliberately searches for positive memories and successfully recalls making a seaweed hat for the crab. The story concludes with Liska excitedly telling Anji she wants to search for good memories like treasures, having internalized this new skill.

## Detailed Q&A

**1. Who are the main characters in the story?**

- **Liska:** A young snow leopard cub who struggles with negativity bias, getting stuck on disappointing events and unable to naturally access positive memories from the same experience.
- **Mara (Mother):** Liska's emotionally attuned mother who validates feelings while teaching concrete strategies for emotional regulation and cognitive reframing.
- **Anji:** Liska's optimistic friend who naturally focuses on positive aspects of experiences, serving as both a contrast to Liska's tendency and a catalyst for her growth.

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**

The story addresses negativity bias—the tendency to get stuck in negative emotions after disappointment, allowing one bad event to overshadow multiple positive experiences from the same situation.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**

Without tools to manage negativity bias, children may: develop a pessimistic worldview that damages relationships; struggle to enjoy activities because they anticipate and focus on potential disappointments; miss opportunities for joy and connection by ruminating on negative events; alienate friends who find their persistent negativity draining; or develop patterns of emotional dysregulation that interfere with learning and play.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**

The solution is learning that while negative emotions come automatically and feel overwhelming, positive memories require active searching—and that this deliberate effort to recall good moments is both possible and worthwhile.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**

The child learns a two-part skill: first, using physical release (stomping and roaring) to reduce emotional intensity, then actively "treasure hunting" for positive memories once calm enough to think clearly.

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**

Based on the Emotional Unfolding Sequence, the story triggers:
- **Anger** sequence (primary): clenched fists, hot prickly feeling in tummy, face feeling tight and warm, turning away to hide
- **Disappointment** leading to anger: the sudden collapse of anticipation when the sandcastle is destroyed
- **Frustration** (early stage of volcano): the grumbling and puffing when unable to appreciate positive aspects

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**

The emotions are central to the story. This is fundamentally about learning to manage anger and disappointment in a way that doesn't prevent access to positive experiences—the entire narrative arc is built around understanding and developing tools to work with negativity bias.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**

The key emotion is **Anger** (specifically the "Little Volcano" variant that builds from frustration to full anger). Developmentally, this is crucial because:
- Anger after disappointment is a universal experience that can dominate a child's entire perception of events
- Learning to physically discharge anger safely is a foundational self-regulation skill
- The transition from anger to actively seeking positive memories teaches cognitive flexibility
- This skill prevents the development of persistent negative thought patterns

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**

The story uses two key metaphors from the Emotional Metaphor System:
- **"Little Volcano (Вулканчик)"** for anger—representing the internal pressure, heat, and bubbling sensation that builds from frustration to full anger
- **"Treasures/Shells on the Beach"** for positive memories—representing how good memories don't come automatically but must be actively searched for and collected

The volcano metaphor is introduced by the mother and helps Liska understand her internal sensations. The treasure metaphor reframes memory recall as an active, rewarding quest rather than passive waiting.

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**

The primary learned coping strategy is **"Strong Stomps"** from the Calming Our Bodies category, enhanced with roaring "like a big snow leopard." This strategy is:
- Physically active, matching the energy of anger
- Concrete and easy for a 5-year-old to remember and execute
- Culturally framed (snow leopard) to feel powerful rather than out of control
- Effective at discharging the physical tension of anger

The secondary strategy (actively searching for positive memories) isn't formally listed in the coping strategies but represents a cognitive skill of deliberate positive recall. Together, they form a complete approach: physical discharge followed by cognitive reframing.
