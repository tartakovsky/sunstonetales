Okay, let's make it that in the yard. In the evening, on the blankets thrown around the well near fire an old neighbor storyteller was telling the story and they offered Liska to be to do their sound effects there may be like some three two or three fun sound effects so when I read them out loud the child should laugh hilariously.

The Cue: Storyteller makes a grand gesture with his hands, signaling for a huge roar.

Liska's Performance: Liska, wanting to do a good job, stands up on her tiptoes, clenches her little paws, and lets out her biggest, baddest roar: a tiny, breathy "mrrrraowr-feh!" It sounds more like an annoyed kitten than a fearsome bear.


### Idea 1: The Grumpy Rhino and the Ladybug

*   **The Story:** A rhino with an enormous, tough-looking horn is very proud of his impenetrable hide. He boasts to all the smaller animals that absolutely NOTHING can bother him. To prove it, he decides to charge through the muddiest, messiest puddle he can find.
*   **The Sounds:**
    1.  **RRRR:** He revs himself up, pawing the ground, and charges toward the puddle with a rumbling, engine-like **RRRRRR**.
    2.  **PRFFFT:** He hits the puddle, hits it, but miscalculates and a massive sheet of mud and water flies everywhere with a giant, wet SPLASH. He emerges, shaking his head, snorting **PRFFFT, covered in mud.
    3.  **SQUEEEAK:** A tiny ladybug, sitting on a leaf that was splashed, lands on the very tip of the rhino's nose and wiggles its antennae. The sensation makes the big, tough rhino freeze, cross his eyes, and let out a tiny, helpless **SQUEEEAK!**. The rhino runs away to avoid tickles.
