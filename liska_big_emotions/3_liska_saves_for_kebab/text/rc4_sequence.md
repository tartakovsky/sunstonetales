# Liska Saves for Kebab: RC4 Emotional Sequence & Slot Analysis

This document outlines the emotional sequence of `rc4_structured.md`, analyzes the implementation of emotional tells and coping mechanisms, and suggests improvements to align with the project's psychological framework.

## Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins

### 2.4: Fallout

- **Emotion Triggered:** `Goal Obstruction` (from `@emotional_triggers.csv`) leading to **Disappointment/Sadness**.
- **Emotional Tells Used (2):**
    1.  `Ушки Лиски грустно опустились.` (Variant of: Sadness -> Head hung low, `@emotional_tells.md`)
    2.  `Её глазки намокли.` (Source: Sadness -> Eyes watery, `@emotional_tells.md`)
- **Internal Sensation:** `Внутри всё стало пусто и холодно.` (Good use of "show, don't tell").
- **Analysis:** The number of tells (2) is appropriate for this beat. The emotion is clearly disappointment. The user's comment `<!-- Can be described better -->` is valid; the internal sensation is good but could be more evocative of a 4-6yo's experience.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve / Unravel – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### 3.1: Recovery (Optional)

- **Auto-Coping Strategy Used (1):**
    1. `Она тихо обняла себя лапками. И спрятала в объятиях свой пушистый хвост.` (Source: Sadness -> Self-Hugging with Tail Inside Hug, `@auto_coping.md`)
- **Analysis:** This is a single, clear coping mechanism. The user's comment `<!-- cute, в объятиях is a bit weird -->` is noted for later phrasing improvements.

### 3.2: Attempt 1 (Initial Reaction / Less Considered Approach)

- **Emotion Triggered:** `Goal Obstruction` (intensified) leading to **Shock and Disappointment**.
- **Emotional Tells Used (3):**
    1.  `У Лиски открылся рот.` (Source: Hurt -> Mouth slightly open in small shock, `@emotional_tells.md`)
    2.  `Ее ушки прижались к голове.` (Source: Sadness -> Shoulders slumped, variant interpretation, `@emotional_tells.md`)
    3.  `Она поплелась к родителям с поникшими усами.` (Variant of: Sadness -> Head hung low, `@emotional_tells.md`)
- **Analysis:** **This is too many body tells for a single moment.** It dilutes the focus. We should consolidate these into one or two of the strongest tells to make the emotional beat clearer and more impactful. For example, `У Лиски открылся рот, а ушки грустно опустились.`


### 3.2: Co-Regulation Scene

- **Analysis of Issues:**
    1.  **Missing Metaphor:** As the user noted, a metaphor is not introduced. This is a good place to introduce one to help Liska understand her feeling of disappointment.
    2.  **Incomplete Co-Regulation:** The father validates her sadness but immediately jumps to problem-solving (`Может, подумаем...`). It's missing the step of letting her express the feeling and sitting with her in it, as per `@co-regulation_guide.md`.
    3.  **No Learned Strategy Taught:** No new internal coping skill is taught.

<!-- Aaand you still didn't recomment anything?! -->

<!-- What we might introduce here? -->
<!-- We also miss introducing a metaphor. We either introduce disappointment metaphor here. Or we introduce helplessness in 3.5. -->

### 3.4: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)

- **Emotion Triggered:** `Performance Failure` (from `@emotional_triggers.csv`) leading to **Helplessness/Self-Doubt**.
- **Auto-Coping Strategy Used (1):**
    1. `Она тяжело села на пол и уставилась в одну точку.` (Source: Helplessness/Self-Doubt -> Sitting Down Heavily, Staring at the Problem, `@auto_coping.md`)
- **Analysis:** The "tell, don't show" issue (`Она чувствовала себя такой беспомощной...`) should be replaced by showing this through her actions and internal thoughts. The single auto-coping mechanism is clear and effective.

### 3.6: Re-evaluation

- **Analysis of Issues:**
    1.  **Missing Learned Coping Strategy:** This is a suitable place to introduce a new, learnable coping strategy. The father provides an *external* solution (the piggy bank), but Liska could also benefit from an *internal* tool to manage the *feeling* of temptation itself. This is an opportunity for character growth.

<!-- I asked you to offer options ffs -->

<!-- Should we introduce it here or in 3.2? -->

### 4.3: The Turning Point / Final Push

- **Analysis of Issues:**
    1.  **Flawed Logic:** The user's comment `<!-- weird, she couldn't buy it anyway. No decision have been made here. -->` is correct. Because Liska leaves the beads at home, there is no moment of decision or self-control tested at the market. The father's praise feels unearned and confusing. The climax is the decision *at home*, but the tension is built at the market, which doesn't align.

<!-- What should be here instead? -->

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. Consolidate Emotional Tells
- **In Act 3.2:** Reduce the three body tells to one or two. For example: `У Лиски открылся рот, а ушки грустно опустились.` This is cleaner and more focused.

### 2. Introduce an Emotional Metaphor
- **In Act 3.2 (Co-regulation):** When Liska expresses her sadness about not having enough beads, and after the father validates her emotion, he can introduce a metaphor for disappointment.

<!-- You just said it's for disappointment and offered metaphor for sadness...  -->
- **Suggested Implementation:**
    - Liska expresses her feeling: `— Мне так грустно, — всхлипнула Лиска. — Я не могу купить шашлычок.`
    - Father validates and introduces metaphor: `— Да, это как тяжёлая дождевая тучка внутри, правда? Грусть от того, что не получилось.`
    - This follows the `@emotional_metaphors.md` pattern (Rainy Cloud for Sadness/Disappointment) and gives a concrete image for her feeling of **Disappointment**.

### 3. Introduce a Learned Coping Strategy
- **In Act 3.6 (Re-evaluation):** After they come up with the piggy bank idea, the father can teach her a simple strategy for when she *feels* tempted, even if she can't act on it.
- **Suggested Strategy:** **"Сосчитай до Пяти" (Count to Five).** This is a simple, concrete mindfulness technique (a `Cognitive/Behavioral` coping strategy). It's a form of pattern interruption to deal with impulsive thoughts.
- **Suggested Implementation:**
    - Father says: `— А когда ты на рынке и очень хочешь чебурек, но нужно копить, попробуй вот что.`
    - He shows her how to slowly tap each finger on her paw, counting: `— Раз, два, три, четыре, пять. Это поможет желанию стать тише.`
    - Liska can practice it once. This gives her an active tool to use in Act 4.

    <!-- Counting is decent -->
