## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere

<!-- a little to the left is lame here. Need something fun for kids -->
Liska and her mother grunted and puffed, wrestling a giant leafy monster through the bedroom door. "A little to the left, Mama!" Liska directed, carefully holding one giant leaf while her mother did all the real lifting with a laugh.

The monstera was magnificent. Its leaves had holes like swiss cheese.

"It's a friendly cheese monster!" Liska declared. "His name is Mr. Cheesy."

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
All day, Mr. Cheesy's shadow was a fun playmate. Morning sun made dancing sun-fairies on the wall. At lunch, his shadow was a lumpy monster trying to eat her carrots. By evening, candlelight made the shadows bow like fancy dancers.

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
As night fell, her mother lifted Liska to the window to wave goodnight to the moon, then tucked her in tight as a cinnamon roll with a special ear scratch and a kiss. A gust of wind rattled the window, and the plant's shadow stretched, swaying with the branches outside.

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
The shadow on the wall changed. The friendly leaf-hands were now long, reaching fingers; the holes, watchful eyes. It was a creeping, many-limbed thing.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)
Liska blinked. *It's just Mr. Cheesy, my friendly monster.* But in the moonlight, Mr. Cheesy looked HUNGRY. Her heart started a drum solo: BA-DUM, BA-DUM. BA-DUM, BA-DUM. She pulled the blanket over her head. "Go 'way," she whispered. "You're just a plant."

### Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)
But under the blanket was worse. What if it crept across the floor? What if it touched her blanket? What if— She threw the blanket off. The shadow’s arms were long, grasping at the walls, grasping at HER. She flew down the hall and crashed into her mother's legs, sobbing, "Mama, the plant has ARMS and it wants to EAT ME!"

### Beat 3.3: Recovery
Her mother scooped her up and carried her back to the bedroom. "That shadow looks so big and scary," she murmured, rocking Liska on the floor cushions. Liska nodded, leaving a wet patch of tears on her mother's nightgown, and maybe a bit of snot. They rocked until the sobs became hiccups. Once Liska was a sleepy weight, her mother tucked her in. As she did, her hand drifted into the moonlight, making a shadow butterfly dance with the leaves. Liska watched, her eyes wide. The shadows were... silly? Not scary? Her mother sat beside her, gently scratching her back until she slept.

### Beat 3.4: Solution Discovery
The next evening, Liska whispered, "Ma-am, I'm still scared of the shadow. Can you help me?"

"Of course," her mother said. "First, let's notice, how does your body feel?"

"My heart beats fast like a drum."

"I see," said her mother. "Then we need to calm down a little. Let's try a special breath. Like we're smelling a flower," she inhaled slowly through the nose, "...and now we have hot soup we want to cool down." she exhaled gently through the mouth. They practiced together. 

Liska smelled a big, pink flower and cooled a whole bowl of pretend soup. The drums in her chest grew quiet.

"Mama," Liska whispered, "remember you played with the shadows 
yesterday? Can we play together?"

"Of course." Her mother made a butterfly land on a leaf shadow. "Maybe you have a friend who can say hello?" Liska hesitated, then made a wobbly bunny-shadow. Her bunny hopped over and wiggled its nose. Soon, they were already telling shadow stories! [missing a sentence of a story here].The butterfly tickled its ear, making it sneeze a shadow-sneeze and hide behind a pillow-mountain.

"We're the shadow dancers!" Liska announced, giggling.

"The very best shadow dancers," her mother agreed. "And shadow dancers know the secret - shadows are just places where light can't go. They can't hurt us. They can only dance."

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

Next night, after their moon-waving and ear-scratching, after her mother's goodnight kiss, Liska found herself alone with Mr. Cheesy again.

The shadow started its creeping dance across the wall.

Thump-thump-thump went the drums. But this time, Liska clutched her sloth. She smelled a flower. *Sniff.* She cooled her soup. *Whoooosh.* Her sloth's fur tickled her nose.

Slowly, like a brave snail, she pushed back her blanket and stood 
up. She walked toward the wall, lifting one shaky paw.

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback
As her shadow-hand neared the plant's, her heart drummed wildly and her hand froze. "Come on, paw," she whispered. "We're shadow dancers."

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested → Learned Skill → Persistence
Squeezing her sloth so hard she worried his stuffing might pop, she took another flower-soup breath and stubbornly pushed her hand forward. Her shadow appeared on the wall - small and wobbly, but THERE. 

"Hi, shadow paw," she whispered. "You're mine. You have to be brave 'cause I said so." 

Her shadow touched the plant shadow. She pushed her paw forward, and...


### Beat 4.4: Success
Nothing happened. No grabbing, no eating. Just her shadow-hand on the shadow-leaf.

"Oh!" Liska breathed. She wiggled her fingers, making the shadows dance together. "You're not scary," she told the shadow. "You're just... you're just a shadow! You can't DO anything!"

### Beat 4.5: Reward → Relief
A warm, sparkly feeling filled Liska's chest. She'd done it! She'd been scared but she'd stayed.

"Shadow dance party!" she announced. She made both hands into shadows now. They became birds, then bunnies, then just happy finger-wiggles. Her sloth made a shadow too when she held him up.

She did a victory dance. The plant shadow swayed as if dancing too. "Okay," she said. "You can dance. But no grabbing!"

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning
In bed, Liska told her sloth, "We did it! The drums came, but we hugged, we smelled the flower and cooled the soup, and then we danced!"

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo
In the morning, Mr. Cheesy's shadow was soft and small and not even a little bit grabby. Still, Liska's chest gave a tiny drum-flutter. She grabbed Slothy, did a flower-soup breath, and made her shadow wave. "Morning, Mr. Cheesy." The plant shadow waved back.

<!-- flower breath etc repeats, we just used it in the previous line. We either narrate it or she tells her mother. Probably narrate, children don't typically give status reports -->
At breakfast, she told her mother, "This morning had just baby drums. I hugged Slothy, did a flower-soup breath, and we had a tiny dance party."

"You found your own brave way," her mother smiled.

"The shadow dancer way!" Liska agreed, doing a little wiggle in 
her chair.

### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
That night, Liska watched the shadow appear. The drums thumped, as they always might. But it was okay. She had everything she needed. "Come on, Mr. Cheesy1," she whispered, hugging her sloth. "Let's dance."
