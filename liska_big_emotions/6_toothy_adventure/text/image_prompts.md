### **Scene 1: The Healer's Waiting Area**

The waiting area is a bright, airy alcove just inside the healer's home. Sunlight streams through a large, open archway fitted with decorative wooden latticework, falling onto a polished stone floor. Against one golden sandstone wall sits a simple, low bench made of dark tropical wood, softened with colorful woven cushions where the main character waits. In the center of the space, a single, vibrant tropical flower with large, waxy petals stands in a large clay pot on a small, three-legged table.

The room is quiet, but not entirely calm. Hiding behind the large flowerpot, a distraught young kit is trying to make himself small. At first, only the tip of one furry ear is visible, twitching nervously. Then, a small, frightened face peeks out from behind a broad leaf. His eyes are wide with distress as he looks at the main character, gesturing pleadingly toward the healer's door, clearly wanting her to go first because he is too scared.

**Key Details to Include:**
*   **Light & Air:** The space remains open and bright, lit by natural sunlight through a decorative archway.
*   **Focal Point:** The large clay pot with its vibrant flower now serves as a hiding spot, drawing attention to the emotional center of the scene.
*   **The Hiding Child:** The visual of a single, twitching ear, followed by a frightened face peeking out, is the key action. His posture and expression must convey his fear.
*   **Atmosphere:** A calm, quiet space that contrasts sharply with the visible distress of the other child. This creates tension and provides an opportunity for the main character to show courage.

### **Scene 2: The Healer's Office (The Cabinet)**

The healer's office is surprisingly bright and meticulously organized. The centerpiece is a cleverly designed patient chair. Crafted from polished dark wood, it can be tilted back not with modern hydraulics, but with a visible system of smooth wooden gears and a foot-pedal lock. It is padded with clean, treated leather.

To one side, on a small wooden table, a clean cloth is laid out with a few small, gleaming instruments. They are not cold steel, but polished brass with carved wooden handles, looking more like precise crafting tools than medical implements. Along the back wall, built-in wooden cabinets with familiar geometric latticework hold clay jars and small wooden boxes, all neatly labeled. Instead of a harsh overhead lamp, a large, clear magnifying lens is mounted on an articulated wooden arm, positioned to catch the sunlight from a nearby window and focus it gently where the healer needs to see.

**Key Details to Include:**
*   **The Chair:** The key element. It must be recognizable as a dentist's chair in function (reclining) but made entirely of period-appropriate materials (wood, gears, leather).
*   **The Instruments:** Small, precise, and made of non-threatening materials like polished brass and wood. They should be laid out neatly, suggesting order and care.
*   **Lighting:** Abundant natural light from a window, focused by a clever, non-electric device like a large magnifying lens on an arm. This provides a smart, technological feel without being modern.
*   **Atmosphere:** The room's defining characteristic is cleanliness and order. Everything has its place. The focus is on skilled craftsmanship and gentle care, not scary procedures.
