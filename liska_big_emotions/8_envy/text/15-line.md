Here is the revised 15-point summary incorporating a more realistic peer dynamic:

1.  (Act 1) Three friends play a simple game, establishing a baseline of fair play.
2.  (2.2-2.3) The protagonist, Liska, loses fairly, triggering an internal feeling of envy.
3.  (2.4) Liska's envy manifests as a "sour grapes" excuse, subtly poisoning the social atmosphere.
4.  (3.2) A subsequent game ends in a funny splash, but the other children's laughter deepens Liska's feeling of envious isolation.
5.  (3.3) Liska attempts to regain control by dictating the next game, causing her friends to naturally disengage from the now-unfun activity.
6.  (3.3) This social failure leads to Liska acting out in frustration, knocking over her own things before stomping away.
7.  (3.4) At her low point, Liska isolates herself and sees her friends having fun without her, which intensifies her envy and sadness.
8.  (3.5) A well-meaning friend first attempts a clumsy, direct "cheer up" approach, which Liska rejects, causing her to withdraw further.
9.  (3.5) A more observant friend then models skillful support, offering a calm, non-demanding presence and initiating parallel play.
10. (3.6) This calm space allows Liska to observe an environmental cue that triggers her *own* memory of a concrete, three-step coping strategy.
11. (4.1) Liska rejoins the group and relinquishes control by letting a friend choose the next game, demonstrating a willingness to change.
12. (4.2) The exact same trigger—the same friend winning—recurs, creating a direct test of her learning.
13. (4.3) She successfully applies the "spot, stop, shift" coping strategy to manage her internal emotional response.
14. (4.4-4.5) She replaces the envious reaction with a pro-social action, which is rewarded by both internal relief and external peer validation.
15. (5.4) Finally, Liska demonstrates integrated learning by reacting with spontaneous, shared joy to a friend's success in a new situation.
