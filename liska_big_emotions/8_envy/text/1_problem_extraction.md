**1. Who are the main characters in the story?**  
**A:** Liska (protagonist), Anji (friend and catalyst for action), Tahrra (friend and insightful observer), Slypaws (friend and mischievous instigator)

---

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** Liska struggles to accept not getting her way in group play, initially refusing to join a game she didn't choose and later complaining when she loses a race, affecting the group's enjoyment.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** Liska's refusal to play and her complaints after losing create tension and reduce the fun for everyone, making her friends feel uncomfortable and disconnected from her.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** Liska learns to prioritize group harmony over her immediate desires by joining games even if they're not her first choice and congratulating others when they win, fostering a sense of togetherness.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** Liska practices taking a deep breath to calm herself and then using positive words like 'Good job!' to acknowledge a friend's success, even when she feels disappointed.

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  
**A:**
- Disappointment -> Sadness: When Liska's choice of game (tag) doesn't win the vote, and she feels left out watching others play hide-and-seek.
- Disappointment -> Anger/Frustration: When Liska loses a race during tag, leading to complaints and excuses due to her negativity bias.

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** Disappointment is central as the story focuses on Liska learning to manage it by adjusting her behavior to maintain group harmony and personal resilience.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** Disappointment (leading to Envy) - It's critical for 4-6-year-olds to learn to handle envy to build social skills like flexibility and graciousness in group settings, preventing isolation or conflict due to comparison with peers.  
**Comments:** Two options from the input are Disappointment leading to Sadness and Disappointment leading to Anger/Frustration. Sadness addresses Liska's initial isolation, while Anger/Frustration ties to her negativity bias. However, as per user feedback, Envy is more accurate as it captures Liska's feelings of being offended and wanting what others have when she doesn't get her way. I choose Disappointment to Envy as the key emotion because learning to manage envy through constructive expression aligns directly with the story's theme of 'playing along' and is a crucial social skill for this age group to prevent peer conflict. If an alternative emotion like Helplessness were more central, it could be considered, but Envy fits the context of group play dynamics.

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** Disappointment will be visualized as the 'Dropping Stone (Упавший Камень)' metaphor, but there is no specific metaphor for Envy in the provided resources.  
**Required Input:** Emotional Metaphors from @emotional_metaphors.md  
**Comment:** The 'Dropping Stone' captures the initial lurch of disappointment when Liska doesn't get her way. However, since Envy is the key emotion, a metaphor for it is needed. As there is no metaphor for Envy in the provided list, it needs to be designed to proceed with the narrative representation.

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** Liska learns to express her feelings of envy using 'Talking About My Feeling,' by saying something like 'I feel bad because I want to play that too,' to a friend, seeking inclusion and reducing comparison.  
**Comments:** Two options from coping strategies are 'Talking About My Feeling' and 'Simple Self-Talk' (e.g., 'I can have fun too'). 'Talking About My Feeling' is developmentally significant as it encourages emotional honesty and seeks support, directly addressing envy by fostering connection rather than isolation, which is effective for 4-6-year-olds in group settings. 'Simple Self-Talk' is also valuable for building internal resilience, but it's less tangible for immediate social resolution. I choose 'Talking About My Feeling' because it aligns with the story's theme of group harmony and teaches constructive expression of complex emotions like envy. Sourced from @coping_strategies.csv under 'Showing My Feelings.'

**Required Input:** Learned Coping Strategies from @learned_coping.md and Coping Strategies from @coping_strategies.csv

**11. Write a paragraph summarizing the story.**  
**A:** In 'Liska Learns to Play Along,' Liska joins her friends Anji, Tahrra, and Slypaws at the park in Sunstone, excited to play tag, but the group votes for hide-and-seek instead. Feeling disappointed, Liska initially refuses to play, watching sadly as her friends have fun without her. She eventually joins in and discovers the game's joy, but later, during tag, she loses a race and complains, upsetting the group. With gentle encouragement from her friends, Liska takes a deep breath to cool her disappointment and congratulates the winner, learning that playing together and supporting each other makes every game more fun, win or lose.
