**Updated Agreement Recap:**

**Core concept**: Liska faces rejection for her specific way of being - not her way of being a cat, but her intense emotionality. She's prone to outbursts, tears, strong feelings (anger, indignation, joy). Other kittens reject this intensity.

**The physical marker**: Heart-shaped central paw pad that persists from baby print to current paw.

**The identification mechanism**: When shown the clay print, Liska discovers her pad has always been heart-shaped. She checks her current paw - still the same shape.

**The revelation structure**: "She's not [too emotional/too intense/too much], she's heart-shaped, always has been." The physical trait validates her emotional nature as intrinsic, not a flaw.

**The treasuring element**: Parents saved this print from babyhood, showing they've always treasured her exactly as she is.

**The emotional arc**: From "I'm too much/wrong" to recognizing her intensity as her heart-shaped nature - always present, always valued.

**The setup function**: This identification must be strong enough that she'll naturally choose the paw print to represent herself in the family belt when trying to hold everyone together.

The precipitating incident still needs development - what specific situation with others triggers her need for this comfort?

**What We Are NOT Doing:**

1. NO **Abstract symbolism** - Not "this print shows you were special then, so you can be special now" logic
2. NO **Contrived representation scenarios** - Not having the print "stand in" for her at events/places
3. NO **Pure uniqueness message** - Not just "you're different and that's okay" without concrete identification
4. NO **Soft/gentle characterization** - She's not "too soft" - she's intensely emotional with full range (anger, indignation, etc.)
5. NO **Species-specific traits** - Not about her "way of being a cat" since everyone's a cat
6. NO **Easy resolution** - Not having her quickly feel better or be convinced by simple reassurance
7. NO **Adult logic** - Not relying on abstract reasoning a 5-year-old wouldn't grasp
8. NO **Print as mere keepsake** - Not just "we kept this because we love you" without the self-recognition element
9. NO **Teaching her to change** - Not about controlling/suppressing her emotional intensity
10. NO **External validation focus** - Not about proving her worth to the other kittens

The story must avoid these pitfalls while building toward her deep identification with the heart-shaped print as her true self - setting up why she'll later use it to represent herself in the family belt.


So now we have:
The sequence:

Yard play interrupted by visiting kitten's separation story
Liska's overwhelming reaction: crying, "He doesn't know when his mom's coming back!"
Other kittens: "You're being a baby"
Liska runs inside, feeling the deep unfairness of being called a baby for having big feelings

The transition:
Mother sees Liska burst in, clinging and upset. After initial comfort, she needs to help Liska understand herself. "Let's go find something in your room" feels like a natural parental redirect - giving the child space to calm down while moving toward the revelation.

Should mother already know about the heart-shaped pad, or should they discover it together in this moment?

Yeah, of course she knows about it, she made it with Liska's paw

Liska has kind of forgot about it, it's just there. Maybe displayed in a frame in her room or something. For Liska it's just a decoration. But for mother it's a cherished thing.

This creates a lovely discovery moment: Mother guides upset Liska to her room, perhaps saying something gentle like "Come, let me show you something." She draws Liska's attention to the framed print that's always been there.
The power is in mother already knowing - she's been watching her heart-shaped kitten navigate the world, knowing this intensity was always part of her. She's been waiting for the right moment to help Liska understand herself.

below is a not very well written example of the correct scene

Liska needs agency here. She compares her print to her paw. Identifies that she's still the same and still unique


**Mother's concise version:**

"See this heart in your baby paw? Look at your paw now - still a heart."

*Shows the framed print*

"You were always a big feelings kitten. Dad and I loved it then. We love it now."

*Maybe touches Liska's current paw*

"The other kittens called you a baby. But you're not. You're heart-shaped."

heart-shaped = Сердцелапка?
