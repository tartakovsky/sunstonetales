<!-- Comment on the whole "rumble" theme

opportunity to build the child's emotional vocabulary? A 4-year-old can understand "angry," "sad," or "frustrated." Does labeling the emotion as "rumbly" obscure the reality of the situation and hinder the child's ability to identify and name these feelings in themselves and others later on?


Accountability: The phrasing "we have big, rumbly feelings" presents the emotion as an external force that happens to the parents, similar to weather. Does this subtly absolve the parents of responsibility for their behavior? Compare it to, "Mama and I are feeling very angry, and we are not handling it well." The latter takes more ownership.

we probably want to drop it.

## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Special sunny corner in the back garden. Safety and happiness atmosphere.

Braid. She's in the sunny corner. The treasures should be specifically these and extremely emotionally resonant.
 -->

The family house was bathed in early morning golden light streaming through the windows. The air was warm and cozy. In the back garden, there was a special sunny corner where the family often curled up together, creating a sense of safety and happiness.

Liska sat in the sunny corner, focused intently on finishing a small, thick belt. It was made of three braided strands. Woven into it were her greatest treasures: a small, rainbow 'courage stone' her father had given her. A tuft of her own white baby-fur that her mother had saved and tied with a silver thread. And a tiny, hardened clay tablet bearing her own first paw-print. Her very first mark on the world. "There," she whispered. "Now you're all safe together."

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid done. Family treasures all together. Tying like a belt is not necessary. She's proud and happy. Really wants to show her parents.
 -->

Her treasure-braid was finally done, tied snug around her waist. It felt like a warm hug. She bounced on her paws, a happy little wiggle starting in her tail. She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parents tense, tense pre-conflict atmosphere
 -->

Liska bounded into the main room and stopped. Papa stood by the window, tail stiff. Mama sat far away, face turned to the wall. Tension between them. This was unusual and unsettling for her.

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parental conflict shown. It hurts Liska. Show mild dysregulation - miffed and sad but not overwhelming
 -->

Liska hesitated, then heard her father's voice, a low rumble, "I just don't understand why." Her mother's voice was a sharp whisper from across the room, "I can't talk about this now." The conflict was now undeniable.

Liska's ears drooped. Her happy wiggle died. She felt a little squeeze in her chest - confused and sad. But she shook her head and gripped her treasure-braid tighter. She could fix this!

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Merging the two attempts. First approach to father fails, then more insistent approach also fails.
-->

Liska approached her father with her belt. Holding it up, she made a simple bid for connection: "Papa, look what I made." He glanced over, offered a distracted, "That's nice, sweetie," and turned away, his mind still on the argument. The failure to connect stung.

Unwilling to give up, Liska stepped right in front of Papa, lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling slightly. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us." Papa finally looked at her, but his eyes were still stormy. He put his paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now. Mama and I need a quiet moment." No reassurance, just the soft push away. Liska's heart crumbled.

### Beat 3.2: Low Point

Liska ran to the hallway and collapsed into the tiniest ball she could make. Her whole body shook with big, gulpy sobs that came from deep in her belly. She pressed her face into her paws, treasure-braid clutched tight against her chest. She wanted to disappear into the floor, to become invisible, to stop feeling this terrible hurt.

### Beat 3.3: Recovery
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Her dysregulation is noticed by her father one way or another, in a way that makes sense from the narrative. It's all raw and heavily emotional still. He breaks away from the argument and comes to her. Co-regulates her. Reassures her. But then goes back into the room.

"We just need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" – this line is good
Replace "rumbly feelings" with something clearer
-->

Her father, Daric, saw her curled into a tight, trembling ball in the hallway. The sight pierced his own upset. He walked over, sat on the floor beside her, and placed a heavy, warm paw on her back. He waited until her trembling subsided, then said softly, "Mama and I... we're feeling big, angry feelings. But our love for you, Liska, is always bigger than any angry. We love you very much." He gave her a gentle squeeze, then added, "We just need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" He then got up and returned to the main room.

### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Liska calms down a bit. Still miffed. Find further support in the braid, looks at the treasures. They remind her of family unity. She remembers the paw pile and gets determined to make parents do it.

should be a bridge from touching the braid "together" to remembering paw pile "together" and wanting to bring them "together"
-->

Alone again, Liska clutched her braid tight. The stone felt solid like Papa. The fur felt soft like Mama. The clay felt warm like home. She thought about their family paw pile - how they'd stack all their paws together and laugh. Her tears stopped. Her eyes got bright with determination. She knew exactly what to do!

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

Liska marched back into the room, braid clutched in one paw. She planted herself between her parents and declared: "LOOK! It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me!"

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback

Her parents just stared. The room went so quiet Liska could hear her own heartbeat thumping like tiny rabbit feet.

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested -> Learned Skill -> Persistence

Before they could speak, Liska grabbed Mama's paw. Then Papa's paw. She pulled them together with all her might and placed her own small paw on top. "Paw pile," she commanded. She pressed down firmly, then let the pile spring back up. "Us. Together," she said, her voice small but stubborn.

### Beat 4.4: Success

Her parents looked at their paws, then at each other, and then down at her. Something melted in their eyes. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug, right in the middle. "We're sorry we worried you," her mother whispered into her fur.

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief

A huge, happy sigh whooshed out of Liska. They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss - all three noses touching in the middle, making a perfect triangle of love. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid and its togetherness should finally click for both Liska and parents.
Developmentally, it should be something along the lines "I can try and make things better?" But not analytical. Focus on her agency in bringing them together.
 -->

They sat together in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring parent sandwich. She looked down at their paws, still stacked together. "I made us remember," she said quietly, feeling proud. Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most."

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Liska seeing/hearing parents making up between each other when they don't notice she's looking. 
Show the new status quo - harmony restored
Integration - she uses her knowledge somehow
 -->

Later, Liska was half-dozing in the sunny corner when she heard her parents talking softly. "I'm sorry I was so sharp," said Father. Mother's voice was warm. "And I'm sorry I went so quiet." Their tails twined together as they spoke.

The next morning, Liska saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. He touched her shoulder gently as he set it down. Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes. The air smelled like cinnamon and felt warm again. Liska bounced between them, her treasure-braid swinging. 

### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
<!-- Make it more emotionally resonant and endearing
 -->
Liska touched each treasure on her braid - stone, fur, clay. Together was better. Always together.
