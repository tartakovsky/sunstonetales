# Revised Tension Curve with All Requested Changes

PLAYFUL START: Liska arranges her magical shell collection in the sunny corner of the den - their special family spot where they always curl up together

HAPPY BASELINE: In this same sunny corner, she plays with shells, imagines beach adventures, feels morning warmth in the spot they'll return to at story's end

DISCOVERY OF PROBLEM: Enters main den to find parents with stiff tails and serious faces, not looking at each other

ATTEMPT 1 (FAILS): "Папа, посмотри на мою ракушку!" - Father barely looks, says "Хорошая" and returns to silence

FEELING: Liska's tummy feels heavy, her tail droops. She feels confused and tense, not understanding why her parents aren't happy. A scary feeling comes - are they mad at her too? Her chest feels tight, like she's been left alone even though they're right there.

ATTEMPT 2 (FAILS): Liska decides she must help make things better. She performs a silly shell dance with exaggerated jumps and wiggles to get attention, but father gently explains: "We need to finish this important talk. We still love you and each other."

LOWEST POINT: Peeks in later, sees mother's wet fur, father's twitching tail. Liska curls into a small ball in the hallway, feeling very sad and not knowing how to help.

FINDING SOLUTION: After feeling sad, she remembers the family picture she drew yesterday - them all playing at beach under sunshine

ATTEMPT 3 (SUCCEEDS): Brings picture, takes both parents' hands in hers: "Мы семья. Помните, что мы любим друг друга. Я люблю вас обоих. Я хочу, чтобы вы оба были со мной вместе." Taking her parents' hands, saying something like we're family, remember that we love each other, I love both of you, I want both of you to be together with me?

BREAKTHROUGH: Parents are moved deeply by her heartfelt words (not just the drawing), looking at each other with softening expressions as they remember their love

CONNECTION: They apologize to each other and to Liska for letting their disagreement come between them, explaining sometimes grown-ups disagree but never stop loving

WARM CELEBRATION: Parents thank Liska for reminding them to talk together instead of apart. The family shares a special triple-kiss, all three putting their lips together at the same time in a triangle of love and unity

PHYSICAL REWARD: They return to the sunny corner where story began, curling up together with Liska in the middle, warm and safe again

LESSON: "В семейных норах иногда гремит, но любовь всегда сильнее ссор" (Family dens sometimes rumble, but love is always stronger than arguments)
