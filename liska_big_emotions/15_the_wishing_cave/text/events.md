### Part 1: Wonder, Hope, and Expectancy

- A child’s hand gently tracing a vein of sparkling crystal on the cave wall.
- The child’s wide eyes, with a parent visible but out-of-focus in the background.
- A shot of the child’s ear, tilted as they listen intently to the low, humming song of the wind in the cave.
- The child carefully picks out the perfect, smooth green leaf to carry their wish.
- A close-up on the child’s face, tongue slightly out in concentration, as they draw two small figures holding hands on the leaf.
- The child folds the leaf with the reverence of a secret ritual.
- A shot from ground level, looking up as the child stands on their toes to reach the perfect crack in the rock.
- Tiny fingers gently pushing the folded leaf into the dark crevice.
- The child places a hand flat on the rock next to their wish, as if making a promise.
- Stepping back, the child clasps their hands together, eyes fixed on the spot where their wish now rests.
- The child turns, a hopeful, expectant smile on their face, scanning the other children for their new friend.
- A view from behind the child, showing them small and separate from the other playing children.

### Part 2: Disappointment

- The hopeful smile slowly melts away as their eyes find no one approaching.
- The child's shoulders slump, their gaze falling from the other children down to their own two feet, standing alone.

### Part 3: Agency Through Observation

- Disappointed, the child sits on the ground, watching the other children play from a distance.
- Their gaze settles on one child who is happily drawing a long, looping pattern in the dirt with a stick. They look calm and absorbed.
- The child takes a small, shaky breath, remembering a parent's gentle advice: "Just say what you see."
- They get up and slowly walk closer, stopping a respectful distance away from the drawing.
- In a quiet but friendly voice, the child says, "Wow... you're making really curly lines."
- The other child looks up, surprised but pleased. "It's not lines! It's the Great River!"
- Our child's eyes widen. They accept the imaginative frame and ask, "The Great River? Where does it go?"
- The other child grins, now fully engaged. "To the Wishing Cave! Want to help me draw the fish that live in it?"
- Our child breaks into a real, happy smile and kneels down, picking up a smaller stick to join in.
- The final shot is of the two of them, side-by-side, heads close together, completely absorbed in their shared river.
- From a distance, the parent watches and smiles, seeing the real magic wasn't the wish, but the first brave word.
