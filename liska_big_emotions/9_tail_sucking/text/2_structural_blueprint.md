# Structural Blueprint: Liska and the Tail-Sucking Habit

## Act 1: Introduction
- **Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and character.**
  - Liska and her family are cloud-gazing. Liska is engaged and imaginative, showing her capacity for focused attention.
- **Beat 1.2: Introduce the problem behavior.**
  - As the family talk continues, the initial excitement wanes. Liska, becoming physically restless, unconsciously brings her tail to her mouth and begins to suckle. She is still listening, but partly disengaged, lost in her own cozy world.

## Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins
- **Beat 2.1: Lead-up.**
  - Later, Mara is reading a story to Liska. The story is captivating, but it's a passive activity. Liska is nestled in, listening intently.
- **Beat 2.2: The Catalyst.**
  - Liska's paws, having no job to do, begin to feel "bored" or "antsy." She shifts, her attention wavers, and she once again automatically reaches for her tail to suckle.
- **Beat 2.3: The Core Incident (The External Problem / Challenge).**
  - Mara pauses the story. Gently, she touches Liska's hand. "It looks like your paws are getting bored," she says softly, naming the behavior without judgment.
- **Beat 2.4: Fallout.**
  - Liska pulls her tail away, a little surprised and confused. The cozy bubble is broken. She doesn't have a word for the feeling, but the interruption makes her feel exposed and a little disconnected from the story and her mother.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve / Unravel – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil
- **Beat 3.1: Recovery (Co-Regulation).**
  - Mara gives Liska a reassuring squeeze. "It's okay. Sometimes my paws get bored, too. They want a job to do." This validates the feeling and frames it as normal.
- **Beat 3.2: Attempt 1 (Introducing the New Idea).**
  - Mara introduces the solution. "When my paws feel bored, I teach them a secret, quiet game. It's called the 'Tummy Drum'." She demonstrates, lightly tapping a rhythm on her own stomach.
- **Beat 3.3: Attempt 2 (Guided Practice).**
  - Liska watches, intrigued by the idea of a "secret game." Mara guides her, "Let's give your bored paws a new job." She helps Liska try the Tummy Drum on herself. The new sensation is a little strange, not as familiar or comforting as her tail. She tries for a moment, then her paw drifts back toward her tail.
- **Beat 3.4: Low Point (Internal Conflict).**
  - The Tummy Drum feels silly, and it's not giving her that instant cozy feeling. Her automatic habit feels easier and better. She feels a flicker of frustration—why does she have to do this new, weird thing?
- **Beat 3.5: Recovery (Reframing & Motivation).**
  - Mara sees the conflict. "A new job takes practice," she says gently. "Let's make it our special secret. We can practice every time we read a story. It's our special 'bored paws' game." This reframes it as a shared, special activity, not a correction.
- **Beat 3.6: Re-evaluation.**
  - The idea of a "special secret" game with her mother is appealing. Liska looks at her paws, then at her mom, and gives a small nod. She's willing to try again.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally
- **Beat 4.1: Final Attempt / Approach.**
  - The next evening, during story time, Liska feels the familiar "bored paws" feeling start to creep in. She automatically starts to raise her tail.
- **Beat 4.2: Rising Tension / Suspense.**
  - She hesitates. She remembers the "secret game." She glances at Mara.
- **Beat 4.3: The Turning Point.**
  - Mara catches her eye and gives a slow, subtle smile, then silently starts tapping her own Tummy Drum. This non-verbal reminder empowers Liska. Liska makes a choice. She diverts her paw from her tail to her own tummy. *Tap... tap... tap.*
- **Beat 4.4: Success (Internal Problem Resolved).**
  - The rhythm is steadying. Her paws have a job. She finds she can focus on the story *and* do the Tummy Drum. The antsy feeling fades. It's working.
- **Beat 4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief.**
  - Mara continues reading without missing a beat, but reaches out and gives Liska's shoulder a gentle squeeze—a quiet acknowledgment of her successful effort. Liska feels a warm bubble of pride.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth
- **Beat 5.1: Relaxation / Immediate Aftermath.**
  - After the story, Liska is still quietly tapping her tummy. She looks up at Mara and smiles. The moment feels connected and harmonious.
- **Beat 5.2: Reflection & Learning.**
  - Mara says, "Your paws did their new job so well tonight." Liska puffs out her chest. "They're not bored anymore," she says.
- **Beat 5.3: Making it Right / Integration.**
  - Later, Liska is playing with her dolls. She arranges them as if they are listening to a story. She then takes the paws of her favorite doll and shows it how to do the Tummy Drum. "This is for when your paws get bored," she instructs seriously.
- **Beat 5.4: New Status Quo / Harmonious Scene.**
  - The family is cloud-gazing again. As the conversation lulls, Liska, without any prompting, quietly starts playing her Tummy Drum, staying present and engaged with the group.
- **Beat 5.5: Concluding Thought / Wrap-up.**
  - Liska had found a new secret game for her paws. It was a good job for bored paws, and it meant she could enjoy the quiet, cozy moments with her family even more.
