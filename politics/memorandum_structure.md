#### Part I: Introduction (Introdução)

1.  **Executive Summary (Sumário Executivo)**
    *   **Objective**: To explain the essence of the document in 30 seconds. This is the most critical part for busy deputies.
    *   **Content**: A brief summary (3-4 paragraphs): who we are, why we are addressing you, the core of the issue (the law is unjust and economically detrimental), and our request (to introduce a transitional period for residents already in the country, as stipulated by the petition, which has gathered over 12,000 signatures).

2.  **Introduction of the Initiative Group**
    *   **Objective**: To demonstrate that we represent a significant segment of society, not a marginal group.
    *   **Content**: We are a community of legal residents of Portugal: entrepreneurs, doctors, scientists, IT specialists, cultural figures, and their families. We have chosen Portugal as our home, we pay taxes, create jobs, and are actively integrating into society.

#### Part II: Argumentation (Argumentação)

3.  **Legal Justification (Fundamento Jurídico)**
    *   **Objective**: To present legal arguments as to why a retroactive change of rules is unjust.
    *   **Content**:
        *   The principle of the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty (Princípio da Proteção da Confiança e da Segurança Jurídica): Individuals have made life plans based on the stability of Portuguese law.
        *   The spirit of the Nationality Law: The purpose of naturalization is integration. Individuals who have lived here for years are already in the process of integration, and changing the rules undermines this process.
        *   International precedent: References to the experiences of Germany and Canada, which are, conversely, liberalizing their legislation to attract talent (materials from V Art).

4.  **Socio-economic Impact (Impacto Socioeconómico)**
    *   **Objective**: To prove that the law is detrimental to Portugal's economy and society.
    *   **Content**:
        *   Economic contribution: Present an infographic with key figures: contributions to social security, taxes, job creation, and startup founding (data from Vlad Shipilov).
        *   Risk of "brain drain": Argue that skilled professionals and investors will leave the country, leading to economic losses.
        *   Demographic aspect: Show how immigrants help combat the nation's aging population and how the new law will exacerbate this problem.

5.  **Humanitarian Dimension (Dimensão Humana)**
    *   **Objective**: To show the human cost of the law.
    *   **Content**:
        *   Stories of families with children: Provide 3-4 brief but powerful anonymous stories of children for whom Portugal is their homeland.
        *   Stories of political refugees: Describe the situation of individuals from Russia and Belarus who cannot return to their home countries and risk becoming undocumented.
        *   Issues for the LGBT community: Explain how the law makes it impossible for LGBT couples to form a family (materials from Vsevolod Belchenko).

#### Part III: Proposal and Conclusion (Proposta e Conclusão)

6.  **Proposed Solution (Proposta de Solução)**
    *   **Objective**: To clearly articulate the desired outcome.
    *   **Content**: We are not asking to repeal the reform. We ask Parliament to demonstrate wisdom and fairness by introducing transitional provisions (norma transitória) into the bill. These provisions should guarantee that all foreign nationals holding a valid residence permit at the time the law enters into force will retain the right to apply for citizenship under the previous conditions (5 years of legal residence).

7.  **Conclusion**
    *   **Objective**: To leave a strong and positive final impression.
    *   **Content**: We believe in the democratic institutions of Portugal. We want to be part of the solution, not the problem. Supporting our initiative is an investment in a stable, predictable, and prosperous future for the country, which we wish to build together with the Portuguese people.
