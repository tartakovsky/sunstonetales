Our Doctors Are Leaving. A New Law Could Drive the Rest Away – Who Will Treat Your Family?
Sub-headline: While Portugal faces record waiting lists and a historic doctor shortage, a proposed change to immigration law threatens to trigger an exodus of the very foreign clinicians who are keeping our National Health Service (SNS) afloat.
(Article Body)
On 18 June 2025, a 37-year-old pregnant woman in Lisbon began experiencing intense pain. Over the next thirteen days, she sought help at five different hospitals, hoping for an emergency C-section. Each unit—overloaded and short-staffed—sent her home. When surgery was finally performed, her 4.5-kg daughter was delivered lifeless.
The case prompted a national outcry; the Minister of Health publicly assumed “political responsibility” while opening an internal inquiry. Investigators have yet to publish final conclusions, but one element is undisputed: every hospital cited manpower shortages as a reason for the refusals.

This tragedy is not an isolated misfortune. It is a brutal snapshot of what happens when a health system runs on empty—and why a pending change to Portugal’s nationality law could push it over the edge.
The SNS is in a state of emergency. As of May 2025, a record 1,644,809 citizens were without a designated family doctor, according to official data from the SNS transparency portal, cited by The Portugal News. The surgical waiting lists are equally crippling, with roughly 242,000 people in the queue, as reported by Portugal Resident.
The root cause is not a lack of trained professionals, but a brain drain. Our doctors and nurses are leaving, driven by conditions and pay that are not competitive. To attract foreign doctors from Brazil, the Portuguese government itself offered a starting salary of €2,863 gross per month. While a start, it highlights the struggle to retain talent when other European nations offer significantly more.
Into this gap have stepped thousands of foreign-born doctors, nurses, and healthcare technicians. As of late 2024, nearly 4,800 foreign doctors and over 1,300 foreign nurses were registered and working in Portugal. They are our colleagues in the ER, the specialists in rural health centers, and the family doctors for over a million Portuguese.
A Change That Risks a "Fatal Blow"
This is the context in which a change to the nationality law is being considered, one that could extend the residency requirement for citizenship from five to ten years.
Government officials may argue the longer period is necessary to deter "passport shopping." Yet, to our knowledge, neither the Ministry of Health nor the immigration agency (AIMA) have presented an impact study on how this will affect critical staffing levels. For many highly skilled professionals, the five-year path to citizenship was a key factor in choosing Portugal—a promise of stability for their families in exchange for their service. Doubling the wait time eliminates this competitive advantage overnight.


Country
	Standard Residency Path to Citizenship
	Portugal (Current)
	5 years
	Portugal (Proposed)
	10 years
	Ireland
	5 years
	France
	5 years
	Spain
	10 years (but only 2 years for Ibero-Americans)
	Belgium
	5 years
	Sweden
	5 years

	As the table shows, a 10-year rule would make Portugal an outlier among its direct competitors for talent, especially when Spain offers a fast track for the very Latin American professionals our SNS depends on.
A Constructive Path Forward
This is not an argument against sensible immigration policy. It is a plea for smart, strategic policy that doesn't cripple our most vital public service. We propose a constructive path forward:
1. A Tiered System: Keep the five-year residency rule for professionals in officially recognized shortage sectors, similar to Germany’s Blue Card or Canada’s Express Entry systems.
2. Fast-Track Diploma Recognition: Streamline the process for recognizing foreign medical diplomas, which, according to the Ordem dos Médicos, can currently take 12–18 months.
3. Mandatory Impact Assessments: Require a body like the Conselho das Finanças Públicas to conduct a binding public-sector impact study before any changes to residency laws are made.
Voices from the Ground
Dr. João Alves*, a Portuguese surgeon whose name has been changed at his request, puts it plainly: "Without my Brazilian and Angolan colleagues, our emergency services would have to close at night. It's that simple." His statement is not an exaggeration; it reflects the reality in multiple hospitals, such as the repeated temporary closures of maternity units in Portalegre and Montijo due to staff shortages.
The question for Portugal is not whether we should have rules, but whether we can afford to have rules that drive away the very people who are holding our healthcare system together.
Rules matter, but so do the people who save our lives.
