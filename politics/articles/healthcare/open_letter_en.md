Subject: An Appeal for Stability for Portugal's Foreign Medics and the SNS

We are doctors and nurses who were trained abroad, and we write to you from inside a National Health Service in crisis. We work every day alongside our Portuguese colleagues to care for patients in a system where 1.7 million people lack a family doctor (SNS Portal) and staff shortages have led to tragedies, including a recent newborn death now under official investigation (Diário de Notícias).

This crisis is deepened by an exodus of local talent. In the last two years alone, 3,000 Portuguese doctors have left to work abroad for better conditions (Ordem dos Médicos [needs sitation]).

For us, the 6,100 foreign medical professionals who have stepped into this gap, the five-year path to citizenship was never about expediency. It was a promise of stability for our families in a country we chose for its safety and community. The proposal to double the residency requirement to ten years breaks that promise. It creates profound uncertainty for those of us who have built lives here and directly destabilizes the healthcare system by destabilizing our lives.

We urge you to consider the human impact of this decision and adopt a sustainable path forward:

1.  Honor the five-year commitment for professionals in recognized shortage sectors like healthcare.
2.  Fast-track the recognition of foreign medical diplomas.
3.  Mandate a binding impact assessment before enacting any change to residency law.

We ask for a policy that honors our commitment and ensures the stability of the health service we are proud to be a part of.


Respectfully,

A Coalition of Concerned Health Professionals and Citizens of Portugal
