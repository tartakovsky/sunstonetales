# 1.7 Million Portugueses Have No Doctor: Who Will Treat Portugal Under a New Immigration Law?

**As the SNS faces a breaking point with 1.7 million people without a family doctor, a new law threatens to drive away the 6,100 foreign medics holding it together by doubling the path to citizenship to 10 years.**

---

A proposed change to Portugal's nationality law (*Lei da Nacionalidade*), doubling the path to citizenship from 5 to 10 years, directly threatens public healthcare. This policy risks driving away the foreign medics our National Health Service (SNS) depends on, pushing an already severe crisis to its breaking point.

> Doubling the path to citizenship from 5 to 10 years threatens to empty our hospitals.

### **A System in Crisis: 1.7 Million Without a Doctor**

The SNS is in crisis. Official data confirms **1.7 million** people lack a family doctor (**ACSS**) and over **244,000** are on surgical waiting lists (**ERS**), many exceeding legal limits.

> With 1.7 million people lacking a family doctor, the SNS is at its breaking point.

**These aren't just statistics; they are tragedies, like the recent death of a newborn after her mother was turned away from five different short-staffed hospitals.**

### **Healthcare Faces a 91% Talent Shortage**

The core of the crisis is a critical labor shortage. A **ManpowerGroup** survey shows **91%** of healthcare employers cannot find qualified professionals—the highest deficit of any sector, proving a structural failure.

> A 91% talent shortage in healthcare is not a gap, it is a structural failure.

### **Fact: Over 6,100 Foreign Medics Are Holding the Line**

As **3,000** Portuguese doctors left to work abroad in the last two years (**Ordem dos Médicos**), **6,100** foreign medics have filled the gap (**The Portugal News**). They are essential, with most of them coming from Brazil (**27%**) and Spain (**35%**).

> While 3,000 of our own doctors leave, over 6,100 foreign medics are keeping the lights on.

### **The New Law Will Cost Portugal Its Doctors**

Portugal's draw isn't high salaries, but its citizenship path. Yet bureaucratic delays already stretch the promised five years to eight or more. A new **10-year** rule erases this key advantage, especially as Spain offers a **2-year** path to the same Ibero-American doctors we need. The law gives **6,100** foreign medics a powerful incentive to leave.

> The proposed law effectively closes the door on the professionals needed to keep the health service open.

### **A Call for a Health-First Immigration Policy**

This is not about avoiding rules; it's about strategic policy to protect public health. We call on Parliament to implement a transitional regime honoring the five-year commitment for residents and mandate a binding impact study by the Conselho das Finanças Públicas before any changes. We urge citizens to contact their representative. 

The question is: Do we want the rules that drive away the very people holding our healthcare system together?

> A transitional regime isn't just policy; it's a lifeline for 1.7 million people.
