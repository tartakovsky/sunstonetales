# 1.7 Million Portuguese Have No Doctor: Who Will Treat Portugal Under a New Immigration Law?

**As the SNS faces unprecedented challenges with 1.7 million people without a family doctor, a new law risks discouraging the 6,100 foreign medics supporting the system by doubling the path to citizenship to 10 years.**

---

A proposed amendment to Portugal's nationality law (*Lei da Nacionalidade*), doubling the path to citizenship from 5 to 10 years, directly impacts public healthcare. This policy change affects the foreign medical professionals our National Health Service (SNS) depends on, potentially worsening an already serious situation.

> Doubling the path to citizenship from 5 to 10 years creates uncertainty for healthcare professionals.

### **A System in Crisis: 1.7 Million Without a Doctor**

The SNS faces significant challenges. Official data from **ACSS** confirms **1.7 million** people lack a family doctor and over **244,000** are on surgical waiting lists (**ERS**), many exceeding legal timeframes.

> With 1.7 million people lacking a family doctor, the SNS requires immediate support.

**These aren't just statistics; they are tragedies, like the recent death of a newborn after her mother was turned away from five different short-staffed hospitals.**

### **Healthcare Faces a 91% Talent Shortage**

The core challenge is a critical labor shortage. A **ManpowerGroup** survey shows **91%** of healthcare employers cannot find qualified professionals—the highest deficit of any sector, indicating systemic workforce challenges.

> A 91% talent shortage in healthcare indicates urgent need for workforce solutions.

"All doctors residing in Portugal or abroad are welcome, provided they have the necessary qualifications to practice medicine and meet the requirements for citizens of third countries, as defined in the Medical Association Registration Regulations (articles 13 and 15)

For the Medical Association, there are no differences in nationalities. And he stresses: 

Given the situation of profound shortage of doctors in the SNS, the arrival of qualified doctors will always be an added value.”

### **Fact: Over 6,100 Foreign Medics Are Supporting the System**

While **3,000** Portuguese doctors have chosen to work abroad in the last two years (**Ordem dos Médicos**), **6,100** foreign medical professionals have joined Portugal's healthcare system (**The Portugal News**). They provide essential services, with most coming from Brazil (**27%**) and Spain (**35%**).

> While 3,000 Portuguese doctors leave to work abroad, over 6,100 foreign medics provide vital healthcare services.

### **The New Law May Discourage Healthcare Professionals**

Portugal's appeal to international healthcare workers isn't primarily financial, but includes a reasonable path to integration. Current bureaucratic processes already extend the promised five years to eight or more. A new **10-year** requirement reduces this advantage, especially as Spain offers a **2-year** path to the same Ibero-American professionals. The law change may discourage the **6,100** foreign medical professionals currently serving Portuguese patients.

> The proposed law may reduce Portugal's ability to attract and retain essential healthcare workers.

### **Healthcare and Immigration: A Complex Balance**

The intersection of immigration policy and public health presents complex challenges. While policy changes reflect various legitimate objectives, their timing coincides with unprecedented healthcare workforce shortages. The experience of current foreign healthcare workers—who entered Portugal under one set of expectations—highlights how policy shifts can have unintended consequences. Perhaps future discussions will consider how transitional measures or impact assessments might help balance competing priorities.

The reality remains: Portugal needs healthcare workers, and healthcare workers need stability. How these two needs align will shape the future of Portuguese healthcare.

> When 1.7 million citizens lack family doctors, every policy decision carries health consequences.
