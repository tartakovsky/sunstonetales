An Open Letter to the Government and People of Portugal To:
The Prime Minister of Portugal The Minister of Health The Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Members of the Assembly of the Republic The People of Portugal

Subject: A Plea for Reason to Save Our National Health Service (SNS) July 4, 2025 We, the undersigned doctors, nurses, and concerned citizens, write this letter with a sense of grave urgency for the future of the health of our nation. We begin with a tragedy that must not be forgotten. On June 18, 2025, a 37-year-old pregnant woman in Lisbon sought help at five different hospitals over thirteen days, desperate for an emergency C-section. Each time, she was sent home. When surgery was finally performed, her daughter was delivered lifeless. The Minister of Health assumed “political responsibility,” and an inquiry was launched, but one fact is undisputed: every hospital involved cited manpower shortages.

This is not an isolated misfortune. It is a brutal symptom of a public health system on the verge of collapse, a system that we, its foreign-born and Portuguese professionals, are fighting every day to keep alive. The facts are stark. As of this summer, 1,644,809 people in Portugal are without a family doctor (The Portugal News). Roughly 242,000 people are on surgical waiting lists (Portugal Resident). Our own medical professionals are leaving, driven away by low pay and precarious conditions. Into this breach have stepped nearly 4,800 foreign doctors and over 1,300 foreign nurses (The Portugal News, Oct. 2024). We work alongside our heroic Portuguese colleagues, patching the holes in a system stretched to its limit. It is in this context of extreme crisis that we are stunned by the proposal to extend the residency requirement for citizenship from five to ten years. For many of us, the five-year path was a promise—a pact of stability for our families in return for our service to yours. To double this timeline is to break that pact. It makes Portugal an outlier in Europe and sends a clear message to skilled professionals: you are temporary, and your future here is not secure. It is a policy that will not only deter new talent but will actively drive away those of us who are already here, holding the line in your hospitals and health centers. We ask you directly: has the government conducted any impact assessment on how this will affect doctor and nurse retention in the SNS? If so, we demand it be made public. If not, we must ask why such a monumental risk is being taken with the health of your citizens. This is not a matter of political ideology; it is a matter of life and death. Therefore, we implore you to consider a more strategic and humane path forward:
Keep the five-year rule for professionals in recognized shortage sectors, such as healthcare. Fast-track the recognition of foreign medical diplomas to get qualified help to patients faster. Mandate a binding impact assessment before any change to residency law is enacted.
We are not asking for special treatment. We are asking for a policy that does not sabotage its own health service. We are asking you to see us not as foreigners, but as the colleagues of your doctors, the nurses for your parents, and the specialists who may one day be called upon to save your child’s life. Do not create a law that will force us to leave. The consequences, as we have already seen, are unbearable. Rules matter, but so do the people who save our lives. Respectfully, A Coalition of Concerned Health Professionals and Citizens of Portugal
