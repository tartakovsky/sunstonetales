# Portuguese Passport: Harder Than German, French and Swedish

A retroactive change to immigration law codifies a decade of bureaucratic delays and raises constitutional questions, affecting hundreds of thousands of legal, tax-paying residents.

### Lei da Nacionalidade

Portugal is built on justice (*justiça*) and trust (*confiança*). A proposed change to the nationality law (*Lei da Nacionalidade*) would double the residency requirement for citizenship from 5 to 10 years—and apply this new timeline retroactively to those already in the system. This introduces a concerning legal precedent—a move legal experts warn, and the **President of the Republic** has noted, may be unconstitutional.

> This law doesn't raise the standard; it risks undermining the state's commitment to those who followed the rules.

### **Administrative Challenges: 400,000+ Applications Pending**

The "5-year" path to citizenship has long faced significant delays. Systemic challenges at state agencies have extended the real wait to **9 to 11 years**, according to **Público**. This law would formalize this timeline, affecting over **400,000** pending applications. Behind these numbers are lives on hold. **"I missed my own father's funeral because I was waiting for a document,"** states one IT specialist who followed all the rules.

### **Legal Concerns: Jurists Question Retroactive Application**

The law's retroactivity raises questions about legal certainty (*segurança jurídica*), a cornerstone of Portuguese law. **President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa** himself has warned that such changes may fail constitutional standards. This legal uncertainty affects Portugal's competitiveness.

> When a state retroactively changes the laws people relied on when arriving, it sends a concerning signal to global talent and investors about legal stability.

"My residence permit expired on January 2nd, and I only managed to submit the renewal application in June, almost by luck. I will probably only receive the new permit almost a year after the previous one expired.

And we have many employees who still can't resolve their situation, without even knowing how to schedule a renewal. The same applies to issuing new permits. Even for highly qualified professionals, and despite lawyers telling us a few years ago that this was a priority category and that the country was interested in attracting this type of talent, right now it seems the opposite. It's starting to feel like they are not really welcome" 

Mikhail Fedorinin, the founder of Albato.

### **The Human Impact: Families Face Extended Separation**

Behind the **400,000** pending cases documented by **Público** are stories of profound personal impact. Legal residents who pay taxes here face travel restrictions and family separation. **"I missed my own father's funeral because I was waiting for a document,"** states one IT specialist. A political refugee, here for five years, adds, "My daughter hasn't seen her grandparents in four years. We came here believing in a 5-year law... With this new law, my journey to stability could take 16 years."

> This isn't just a delay; for current residents, it's a decade of fear for their future.

### As Portugal Considers a 10-Year Wait, Leading EU Economies Maintain 5-Year Paths

This policy positions Portugal differently from competing economies. While Portugal considers extending to 10 years, our European partners maintain faster, more predictable paths for integrated residents and skilled professionals.

| Country | Standard Residency Path to Citizenship |
| --- | --- |
| **Portugal (Proposed)** | **10+ years** |
| Germany | 5 years |
| Ireland | 5 years |
| France | 5 years |
| Belgium | 5 years |
| Sweden | 5 years |
| United Kingdom | 6 years (Skilled Worker/Global Talent) |
| Spain | 2 years for Ibero-Americans |

> The extended timeline affects those who contribute to social security and staff essential services

Every one of us values security and belonging. Integrating into a new society requires long-term planning, based on the laws in place when people arrive. Changing these expectations creates uncertainty for those who have already begun their integration journey.

### **A European Reality Check**

The numbers tell an interesting story. While Germany, France, and Sweden maintain 5-year paths to citizenship, Portugal considers doubling to 10 years—on top of existing delays that already stretch the actual wait to **9-11 years**. The **400,000** pending applications and constitutional questions raised by the **President of the Republic** about retroactive application create a distinctive moment in European immigration policy.

As skilled professionals plan careers across decade-long horizons, these timeline differences matter. The convergence of administrative backlogs, retroactive rule changes, and the longest citizenship path among major EU economies positions Portugal uniquely in the global competition for talent. How this plays out will shape migration patterns across Europe for years to come.

> When citizenship timelines double while European neighbors maintain shorter paths, the mathematics of global mobility shift in ways that echo through economies for decades.
