# The 10-Year Wait: Is Portugal's New Citizenship Law Constitutional?

**A retroactive change to immigration law codifies a decade of bureaucratic delays and raises constitutional questions, punishing hundreds of thousands of legal, tax-paying residents.**

---
Portugal is built on justice (*justiça*) and trust (*confiança*). A proposed change to the nationality law (*Lei da Nacionalidade*) undermines both. Applying new rules retroactively introduces a dangerous legal precedent—a move legal experts warn, and the President of the Republic has noted, may be unconstitutional.

> This law doesn't raise the standard; it risks breaking the state's promise to those who followed the rules.

### **A System in Collapse: 400,000+ Lives in Limbo**

The "5-year" path to citizenship is a myth. Systemic failures at state agencies mean the real wait is already **9 to 11 years**. This law formalizes that failure, affecting over **400,000** pending applications. Behind these numbers are lives on hold. **"I missed my own father's funeral because I was waiting for a document,"** states one IT specialist who followed all the rules.

> We are not just losing talent; we are telling the world that Portugal's word is not its bond.

### **The Red Flag: Jurists Warn Retroactive Laws Erode Trust in the State**

The law's retroactivity violates legal certainty (*segurança jurídica*), a cornerstone of Portuguese law. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa himself has warned that such changes may fail constitutional standards. This legal instability makes Portugal uncompetitive.

> When a state breaks its own rules, it warns global talent and investors: your future is not safe here.

### **The Human Cost: Families Separated by Bureaucracy**

Behind the **400,000** pending cases are stories of profound personal cost. Legal residents who pay taxes here are unable to travel, see dying relatives, or plan their lives. **"I missed my own father's funeral because I was waiting for a document,"** states one IT specialist. A political refugee, here for five years, adds, "My daughter hasn't seen her grandparents in four years. We came here believing in a 5-year promise... With this new law, my journey to stability could take 16 years."

> This isn't just a delay; it's a decade of fear for their future that tells the world's top talent to look elsewhere.

### **The Cost: As Portugal Adopts a 10-Year Wait, EU Rivals Welcome Talent Faster**

This policy makes Portugal uncompetitive. While we make a 10-year wait official, our European partners offer faster, more reliable paths for integrated residents and skilled professionals.

| Country | Standard Residency Path to Citizenship |
| --- | --- |
| **Portugal (Proposed)** | **10+ years** |
| Germany | 5 years |
| Ireland | 5 years |
| France | 5 years |
| Belgium | 5 years |
| Sweden | 5 years |
| United Kingdom | 6 years (Skilled Worker/Global Talent) |
| Spain | 2 years for Ibero-Americans |

> The law punishes the very people we need to finance our social security and staff our hospitals

### **The Solution: A Fair Transition and Responsible Governance**

Instead of punishing those who followed the rules, Parliament must implement a fair transitional regime that honors the five-year commitment for those who already live, work, and contribute to Portugal. Furthermore, to prevent future shocks to our legal and economic system, any future changes to residency or nationality laws must be preceded by a binding impact study from an independent body like the **Conselho das Finanças Públicas (Public Finance Council)**. This ensures that policy is driven by data, not political impulse.

> É necessário um regime de transição que honre o compromisso de cinco anos. A Assembleia da República precisa de rever as consequências da lei.
