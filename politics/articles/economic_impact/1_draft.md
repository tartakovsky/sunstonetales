The €3 Billion Question: Who Will Pay for Portugal’s New Immigration Law?
**A proposed amendment to Portugal's *Lei da Nacionalidade* threatens a nearly €3 billion annual surplus from immigrant contributions, jeopardizing Social Security and forcing a choice between higher taxes or service cuts.**

We all want a prosperous and stable Portugal. This shared goal depends on pragmatic, evidence-based policy. However, the proposed amendment to the *Lei da Nacionalidade*, which doubles the residency requirement for citizenship to ten years, ignores official data and creates a problem where none exists. It is an act of economic self-sabotage.

### **84% of Portuguese Companies Cannot Find Workers**

Portugal is in a national talent crisis. A **2025 ManpowerGroup survey** found that a staggering **84% of employers** report difficulty finding the skilled workers they need. This is not a future projection; it is a present-day reality crippling businesses' ability to grow and compete.

This crisis was predicted. A 2017 study by the Fundação Francisco Manuel dos Santos warned that without immigration, Portugal faced a long-term deficit of up to 2.6 million jobs, calling immigration "vital for the country's sustainability." The warnings were ignored.

### **Immigrants Deliver a €3 Billion Surplus to Social Security**

While businesses search for talent, immigrants are providing a crucial financial lifeline to the state. According to the *Ministério do Trabalho, Solidariedade e Segurança Social (MTSSS)*, foreign residents contributed **€3.6 billion** to Social Security in 2024, while receiving only **€687 million** in benefits.

This is a **net annual profit for the Portuguese state of nearly €3 billion.** For every euro an immigrant receives, they contribute more than five. This surplus directly funds the pensions and benefits of Portuguese citizens. Both the *Banco de Portugal* and the OECD (*Organização para a Cooperação e Desenvolvimento Económico*) have confirmed the "markedly positive" fiscal impact of immigrants, who are "mitigating labour shortages."

### **Portuguese Taxpayers Will Foot The Bill**

The new ten-year rule does not affect illegal immigrants, who operate outside the legal system. It punishes those who play by the rules: the qualified, tax-paying specialists, entrepreneurs, and doctors who chose Portugal based on a clear five-year path to stability. Faced with another decade of uncertainty, they will not wait. They will take their skills, investments, and businesses to countries with more predictable legal frameworks.

When this €3 billion surplus vanishes, who will cover the shortfall? The answer is simple: Portuguese citizens. The government will be forced to choose between raising taxes on families and businesses or making painful cuts to healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

### **A Pragmatic Path Forward**

This is not an immigration debate; it is a fiscal one. As the initiators of a petition with over 12,000 signatures, we propose a constructive solution grounded in fairness and legal certainty (*segurança jurídica*). We ask for a transitional regime that honors the five-year commitment to those who moved their lives to Portugal in good faith.

Portugal's future depends on stability, not self-inflicted economic wounds. Let us choose pragmatism over politics and build our future on a foundation of stable rules and mutual trust.
