As the initiators of the petition presented to the Assembleia da República, which has now gathered over 12,000 signatures, we want to be clear. We are not strangers demanding special treatment. We are the legal residents this law targets: the engineers, doctors, entrepreneurs, and parents who chose Portugal as our home based on a clear and stable legal framework. We built our lives, invested our savings, and integrated our children into Portuguese schools, all while trusting in the promise of a five-year path to stability.
Our petition, grounded in the Portuguese constitutional principles of legal certainty and protection of trust, makes a simple, fair demand: either abolish this self-destructive law entirely, or, at the very least, honor the promise made to those of us who are already here. We ask for a transitional regime that maintains the five-year requirement for those who, in good faith, have already established their lives in Portugal. To change the rules mid-game is not just an administrative change; it is a retroactive betrayal that undermines the very idea of Portugal as a fair and predictable country.
This new law is an act of economic self-sabotage. It is a direct threat to the 84% of businesses that cannot find workers. It is a threat to the financial stability of our pension system. It is a betrayal of the social and economic contract that has kept Portugal afloat.
This is not a debate about immigration. This is a fight for Portugal's economic sanity. This law must be seen for what it is: The Great Betrayal.
