# The Price of the New Immigration Law: €3 Billion

The amendment doubles residency requirements while threatening the €2.9 billion immigrant-generated Social Security contributions that fund Portugal's public services, arriving just as 84% of Portuguese companies report they cannot find workers.

## Lei da Nacionalidade

Portugal's security and prosperity depend on pragmatic, evidence-based policy. Yet, an amendment to the Lei da Nacionalidade presented as a measure to create order does the opposite. The amendment doubles the legal residency requirement for citizenship from 5 to 10 years. This decision has drawn criticism from immigrant organizations, human rights advocates, and parts of the legal community. By changing the rules retroactively, it risks alienating the very people whose contributions support Portugal's fiscal health.

**Residents will need to wait 10 years before they can apply for citizenship. It was 5 when they arrived.**

## A Present Crisis: 84% of Portuguese Companies Cannot Find Workers

This is not a future problem; it is a current crisis. A **ManpowerGroup** survey for 2025 found 84% of Portuguese employers cannot find the skilled workers they need. This chokes our economic growth. The warning was sounded years ago: a 2017 **Fundação Francisco Manuel dos Santos** study warned that without immigration, Portugal faced a deficit of 2.6 million jobs. The conclusion was clear: immigration is vital for the country's economic sustainability. Adding urgency, the **European Commission** projects Portugal will face one of Europe's worst pension system crises by 2050.

**84% of Portuguese employers cannot find skilled workers while Portugal faces a deficit of 2.6 million jobs.**

## Immigrants Contribute €2.9 Billion to Social Security

It's 5.3 times more than they receive. While Portuguese companies hunt for workers, official data from the **Ministério do Trabalho, Solidariedade e Segurança Social** shows that foreign residents are significant contributors to pensions and benefits for citizens. In 2024, foreign residents contributed €3.6 billion to Social Security while receiving only €687 million in benefits—a 5.3-to-1 contribution ratio. This delivered a €2.9 billion net profit to the Portuguese state. This is not abstract money. This contribution from foreign workers makes up 12.4% of all Social Security financing. That means immigrants help pay for 12.4% of all pensions in Portugal. The **Banco de Portugal** confirms immigrants "mitigate labour shortages," and the **OECD** agrees their fiscal impact is "markedly positive."

**For every euro an immigrant receives, they contribute five. It's €3.6 billion or 12.4% of all Social Security financing.**

## The Law Misses Its Target

Undocumented immigrants operate outside the law; they would not become citizens as that requires being a legal resident. The actual targets are the legal, tax-paying residents Portugal needs: the engineers, doctors, and entrepreneurs who came here based on a clear legal framework – contribute to a good country and be able to become citizens and integrate. For global talent and the investors who back them, predictability is everything. Changing the rules retroactively sends one message: Portugal is eroding trust with legal immigrants.

**Illegal immigrants are not affected by the law. For legal immigrants, Portugal is undermining the foundation of trust.**

## Citizens Are To Foot the Bill

If skilled residents and their businesses leave, they will not pay €2.9 billion that are used to fund pensions, healthcare, and education. With the **European Commission** already warning of a severe pension crisis by 2050, can Portugal afford to lose these vital contributions? Perhaps there is still time to find a balanced approach to immigration that preserves the economic benefits while addressing legitimate concerns about integration and security.

## Economics and Immigration: A Delicate Balance

The data reveals a clear pattern: foreign residents contribute €3.6 billion while receiving €687 million—a mathematical reality that shapes Portugal's fiscal landscape. As the country faces both severe worker shortages and a looming pension crisis, the intersection of immigration policy and economic necessity becomes increasingly significant.

Portugal's challenge is unique: needing 2.6 million workers while potentially discouraging those already contributing billions to the system. How this balance is managed will determine not just immigration statistics, but the sustainability of social systems that all Portuguese depend on.

> When 84% of companies can't find workers and immigrants fund 12.4% of pensions, every policy choice carries economic consequences.
