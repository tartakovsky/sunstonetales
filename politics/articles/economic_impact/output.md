# The €3 Billion Question: Who Will Pay for Portugal’s New Immigration Law?

A new law threatens the €2.9 billion immigrant-generated Social Security contributions that fund Portugal's public services, arriving just as 84% of Portuguese companies report they cannot find workers.

## Lei da Nacionalidade

Portugal's security and prosperity depend on pragmatic, evidence-based policy. Yet, a change to the Lei da Nacionalidade presented as a measure to create order does the opposite. By doubling the residency requirement for citizenship, it breaks a foundational promise made to legal residents and risks alienating the very people whose contributions support Portugal's fiscal health.

**Residents will need to wait 10 years before they can apply for citizenship. It was 5 when they arrived.**

## A Present Crisis: 84% of Portuguese Companies Cannot Find Workers

This is not a future problem; it is a current crisis. A ManpowerGroup survey for 2025 found 84% of Portuguese employers cannot find the skilled workers they need. This chokes our economic growth. The warning was sounded years ago: a 2017 Fundação Francisco Manuel dos Santos study warned that without immigration, Portugal faced a deficit of 2.6 million jobs. The conclusion was clear: immigration is vital for the country's economic sustainability.

**84% of Portuguese employers cannot find the skilled workers while Portugal faces a deficit of 2.6 million jobs.**

## Immigrants Contribute €2.9 Billion to Social Security

It's 5.3 times more than they receive. While Portuguese companies hunt for workers, official data shows that foreign residents are significant contributors to pensions and benefits for the citizens. In 2024, foreign residents contributed €3.6 billion to Social Security while receiving only €687 million in benefits—a 5.3-to-1 contribution ratio. This delivered a €2.9 billion net profit to the Portuguese state. This is not abstract money. This contribution from foreign workers makes up 12.4% of all Social Security financing. That means immigrants help pay for 12.4% of all pensions in Portugal. The Banco de Portugal confirms immigrants "mitigate labour shortages," and the OECD agrees their fiscal impact is "markedly positive."

**For every euro an immigrant receives, they contribute five. It's €3.6 billion or 12.4% of all Social Security financing.**

## The Law Misses Its Target

Undocumented immigrants operate outside the law; they would not become citizens as that requires being a legal resident. The actual targets are the legal, tax-paying residents Portugal needs: the engineers, doctors, and entrepreneurs who came here based on a clear legal promise – contribute to a good country and be able to become citizens and integrate. For global talent and the investors who back them, predictability is everything. Changing the rules retroactively sends one message: Portugal is not legally safe for immigrants.

**Illegal immigrants are not affected by the law. For legal immigrants, Portugal is breaking its legal promise.**

## Portuguese Citizens Are To Foot the Bill

If skilled residents and their businesses leave, they will not pay €2.9 billion that are used to fund pensions, healthcare, and education. Who will?

## A Call for Pragmatism and a Secure Future

This is not a question of politics, but of simple math. As the initiators of a petition with over 12,000 signatures, we are the legal residents who invested in Portugal in good faith. We ask not for special treatment, but for sound policy that was in place when we arrived.

> **Decision Needed:** What exactly are we proposing? Keep 5 years for pros? Transitional regime?

A reasonable path forward is clear: **Implement the transitional regime that honors the five-year commitment for those who are already living, working, and contributing in Portugal.** A body like the Conselho das Finanças Públicas needs to conduct a binding public-sector impact study before any changes to residency laws are made. To secure Portugal's economic future, we must choose evidence over rhetoric. We urge the Assembleia da República to reconsider this law and its tangible consequences. We invite every citizen concerned with Portugal's prosperity to join this call for a pragmatic solution.

**Transitional regime is needed that honors the five-year commitment. Assembleia da República needs to review the consequences of the law.**
