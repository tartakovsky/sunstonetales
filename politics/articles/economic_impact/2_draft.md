**The €3 Billion Question: Who Will Pay for Portugal’s New Immigration Law?**

A new law threatens the **€2.9 billion immigrant-generated Social Security contributions** that fund Portugal's public services, arriving just as **84% of Portuguese companies report they cannot find workers**.

---

Portugal's security and prosperity depend on pragmatic, evidence-based policy. Yet, a change to the *Lei da Nacionalidade* presented as a measure to create order does the opposite. By doubling the residency requirement for citizenship, it breaks a foundational promise made to legal residents and risks alienating the very people whose contributions support Portugal's fiscal health.

### **A Present Crisis: 84% of Portuguese Companies Cannot Find Workers**

This is not a future problem; it is a current crisis. A **ManpowerGroup survey for 2025** found **84% of Portuguese employers cannot find the skilled workers they need**. This chokes our economic growth. The warning was sounded years ago: a 2017 **Fundação Francisco Manuel dos Santos** study warned that without immigration, Portugal faced a deficit of **2.6 million jobs**. The conclusion was clear: immigration is vital for the country's economic sustainability.

### **Immigrants Contribute €2.9 Billion to Social Security – 5.3 Times More Than They Receive**

While Portuguese companies hunt for workers, official data shows that foreign residents are significant contributors to pensions and benefits for the citizens. In 2024, foreign residents contributed **€3.6 billion** to Social Security while receiving only **€687 million** in benefits—a **5.3-to-1 contribution ratio**. This delivered a **€2.9 billion net profit** to the Portuguese state. This is not abstract money. This contribution from foreign workers makes up **12.4% of all Social Security financing**. That means they help pay for **12.4% of all pensions in Portugal**. The **Banco de Portugal** confirms immigrants "mitigate labour shortages," and the **OECD** agrees their fiscal impact is "markedly positive."

### **The True Cost: Who Foots the Bill for Unstable Policies?**

This law misses its supposed target. Undocumented immigrants operate outside the law; they would not become citizens anyway as that requires being a legal resident. The actual targets are the legal, tax-paying residents Portugal needs: the engineers, doctors, and entrepreneurs who came here based on a clear legal promise – contribute to a good country and be able to become citizen and integrate. 

For global talent and the investors who back them, predictability is everything. Changing the rules retroactively sends one message: **Portugal is not legally safe for immigrants**. If these skilled residents and their businesses leave, it would mean less money from taxes and fewer new jobs, which would make it harder to fund public services like healthcare and education.

### **A Call for Pragmatism and a Secure Future**

This is not a question of politics, but of simple math. As the initiators of a petition with over 12,000 signatures, we are the legal residents who invested in Portugal in good faith. We ask not for special treatment, but for sound policy that was in place when we arrived.

[[DECISION NEEDED: What exactly are we proposing? Keep 5 years for pros? Transitional regime?]]
A reasonable path forward is clear: Implement the transitional regime that honors the five-year commitment for those who are already living, working, and contributing in Portugal. A body like the Conselho das Finanças Públicas needs to conduct a binding public-sector impact study before any changes to residency laws are made.

To secure Portugal's economic future, we must choose evidence over rhetoric. We urge the Assembleia da República to reconsider this law and its tangible consequences. We invite every citizen concerned with Portugal's prosperity to join this call for a pragmatic solution.
