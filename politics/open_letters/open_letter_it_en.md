### An Open Letter to the Government and People of Portugal

**From the international technology professionals who have chosen Portugal as their home.**

**To His Excellency the Prime Minister, the esteemed members of the Assembly of the Republic, and the people of Portugal,**

We begin this letter with a simple but profound sentiment: thank you. We write to you today not as strangers, but as your neighbours, your colleagues, and as members of communities across this beautiful country we have chosen to call home.

Many of us arrived here from nations shaken by war, political instability, and authoritarian rule. We chose Portugal not by chance, but for its values. We were drawn by its reputation as a beacon of peace, democracy, and warmth—a country that bravely chose freedom and has since offered a safe harbour to so many. You welcomed us, and for this, we and our families are eternally grateful.

We were also drawn by Portugal’s vision for the future. We have enthusiastically answered the call to help build this country into a leading European technology hub, a goal championed by the government through ambitious strategies like the **Action Plan for Digital Transition** and **INCoDe.2030**.

We are proud to be a significant part of this national project. Non-Portuguese professionals now make up **15.7% of the entire IT workforce** residing in the country, a figure that saw a significant increase of 5.1% in the last year alone. We are here, we are committed, and we are growing with Portugal.

Our stories are diverse, but our commitment is shared.

> "I came to Portugal to give my family the safety I never had. As a software engineer at a Portuguese company, I am proud to contribute my skills. My only hope is to continue building our life here with the certainty that our children have a stable future."
> 

> "As a freelance data scientist, I chose Lisbon for its vibrant ecosystem. I pay my taxes here and my clients are both local and international, bringing foreign income into Portugal. Predictability in my legal status is essential for me to continue serving my clients and investing in the local economy."
> 

> "I founded my startup in Porto and now employ ten people, including seven Portuguese citizens. Our growth depends on attracting top talent from around the world. The legal stability for immigrants is not an abstract issue—it is a critical factor for innovation, investment, and job creation."
> 

Our greatest hope is to give our children the one thing many of us never had: the certainty of a stable and peaceful future. We want them to grow up with Portuguese friends, to celebrate São João and Santo António, and to feel, deep in their hearts, that this land is their land.

It is with this spirit of shared commitment and deep respect that we wish to voice a concern that has cast a shadow of anxiety over our families. The recent discussions and uncertainty surrounding immigration laws have created a sense of unpredictability that is unsettling for those of us who have staked our entire futures on the promise of Portuguese stability.

We appeal for a constructive dialogue to establish a clear, predictable, and stable path forward for those who are already here, working and contributing to Portuguese society. We believe that such stability is essential for successful integration and for the long-term prosperity of Portugal itself.

This is not a letter of demand, but an appeal for dialogue and understanding. We are not asking for special treatment, only for the chance to continue building our lives and contributing to the future of a country we have come to love.

We believe in a future we can build together—a Portugal that is not only historic and beautiful but also innovative, open, and a symbol of hope for the world. We put our trust in Portugal's tradition of wisdom, humanity, and foresight.

With the deepest respect and hope for our shared future,

A collective of international technology professionals who call Portugal home.
