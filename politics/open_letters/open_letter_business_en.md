### An Open Letter to the Government and People of Portugal

**From the international entrepreneurs who have invested our futures in Portugal.**

**To:
The Prime Minister of Portugal
The Minister for Parliamentary Affairs
Members of the Assembly of the Republic
The People of Portugal**

It is with the deepest respect for the people and institutions of Portugal that we write to you today. As international entrepreneurs who have chosen to build our lives and businesses here, we are profoundly grateful for the welcome you have given us, and for the values of peace, democracy, and stability that this nation represents.

Our commitment is not in words, but in action. Collectively, foreign-led businesses are a powerful engine for the Portuguese economy, employing nearly **700,000 people**. As a group, immigrants contribute a net **€2.9 billion** to Social Security, helping to fund **12.4% of all national pensions**. We are proud to help guarantee the dignity of the older generations while we invest in the younger ones.

We are not temporary residents; we are building legacies. Our children attend Portuguese schools. We are restoring old buildings for our offices and investing in local suppliers. Their future and ours are intertwined with this nation's.

Long-term investment and job creation depend on a stable and predictable legal environment. The recent uncertainty surrounding residency laws creates significant risk, not just for us, but for the thousands of Portuguese citizens we employ and for the future investments we plan to make.

This is not a letter of demand, but an appeal for constructive dialogue. We humbly ask you to consider the message this sends to the global investment community. Let us find a balanced solution that honours the contributions of those already building their lives here and reinforces Portugal’s reputation for fairness and foresight—qualities that make this nation a trusted destination for investment.

We believe in a future we can build together. We put our trust in Portugal's tradition of wisdom and foresight to secure our shared prosperity.

With our deepest respect and unwavering commitment to the future of Portugal,

A collective of international entrepreneurs in Portugal.
