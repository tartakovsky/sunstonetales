You are absolutely right. Thank you for that crucial feedback. The tone had shifted too far towards grievance and lost the essential element of respect and partnership. A demanding tone will alienate the very people we need to reach.


Let's craft a new version that is built on respect, shared values, and the powerful emotional anchor of family and integration. This letter will frame the hardship of diploma recognition not as a complaint, but as profound proof of a long-term commitment to Portugal.


This version is designed to be persuasive, heartfelt, and impossible to dismiss as manipulative.

### **An Open Letter to the Government and People of Portugal**


**From the international medical professionals who have chosen to call Portugal home.**


**To His Excellency the Prime Minister, the esteemed members of the Assembly of the Republic, and the people of Portugal,**


We write this letter with a profound sense of respect and gratitude. We are your neighbours, your colleagues, and for many of you, we are the doctors and nurses you meet in moments of need. We are the international medical professionals who have not only chosen to work in Portugal but to build our lives and raise our families here.


We came to Portugal seeking the peace, democracy, and warmth that this nation offers so generously. We found a country where we could envision a future for our children, and for that, we are deeply thankful.


Our commitment to becoming part of Portuguese society was made long before we treated our first patient. We willingly undertook the **"Reconhecimento Específico"**—a long and demanding path to validate our medical qualifications to the highest Portuguese standards. For many of us, this journey took several years of intense study and personal investment. We knew the path was difficult, but we chose it because our goal was not simply to find a job, but to earn the trust of the Portuguese people and serve this nation for the long term.


This process forged an unbreakable bond. We are not outsiders; we are deeply integrated into the fabric of Portuguese life. We are with your families in life’s most important moments—from the joy of childbirth to the quiet dignity of care. We share stories with our patients, we have learned their histories, and we have celebrated their recoveries.


Our children are growing up here. They attend Portuguese schools, play in local parks, and cheer for the same football clubs as their friends. They are building their futures on Portuguese soil, and their dreams are intertwined with the future of this nation. We celebrate São João with our neighbours, we bring pastéis de nata to our work colleagues, and we feel a sense of pride in the communities we now call home.


It is an honour to work alongside our Portuguese colleagues to strengthen the National Health Service (SNS), a service we also rely on with our own families. We know the immense pressure the SNS is under, with **over 1.5 million people** seeking a family doctor. We are proud to be part of the solution, helping to ensure that a fellow resident in the Algarve or a family in the interior has a doctor when they need one.


It is with this spirit of deep commitment and for the sake of our shared future that we wish to voice a concern. The recent uncertainty surrounding immigration laws has created a quiet anxiety for our families. It creates a fragility in the lives we have worked so hard to build and threatens the stability our children deserve and our patients depend on.


This is not a letter of demand, but an appeal for partnership. We humbly ask you to consider the human impact of this decision and honor the five-year commitment for professionals in recognized shortage sectors like healthcare.

We ask for the stability that allows us to be the best doctors, the best parents, and the best neighbours we can be—for the good of the nation we are so proud to serve.

We believe in a future where every person in Portugal has access to the care they deserve and where all who contribute to this nation can plan their lives with confidence. We place our trust in Portugal's enduring wisdom and humanity.


With the deepest respect and hope for our shared future,


A collective of international medical professionals who call Portugal home.
