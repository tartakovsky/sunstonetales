### **An Open Letter to the Government and People of Portugal**


**From the international entrepreneurs who have invested our futures in Portugal.**


**To His Excellency the Prime Minister, the esteemed members of the Assembly of the Republic, and the people of Portugal,**


We write to you as partners in building the future of Portugal. We are the entrepreneurs, investors, and business owners from around the world who have chosen to make this nation our home. We did not come here merely seeking opportunity; we came seeking a society built on the values of freedom, stability, and respect for the individual—values that are not guaranteed in our countries of origin.


Many of us have deliberately moved our companies, our capital, and our teams from autocratic nations to plant our flag in Portuguese soil. We chose Portugal because it represents the democratic ideals and the peaceful future we want for our businesses and, most importantly, for our children.


We are deeply grateful for the welcome we have received. In return, we have committed ourselves completely to contributing to the economic and social vitality of this nation. Our commitment is not just in words, but in action and investment.


Collectively, foreign-led businesses are a powerful engine for the Portuguese economy. In 2023 alone, new foreign investment projects aimed to create over **18,000 jobs**. As of today, companies with foreign capital already employ nearly **700,000 people** across the country. We are creating roles in technology, services, and industry, providing skilled employment for Portuguese citizens and helping to reverse the trend of brain drain.


Our contribution extends to the very heart of the social contract. As a group, immigrants now contribute enough to the social security system to fund **17% of all national pensions**. We are proud to help guarantee the dignity of the older generations while we invest in the younger ones.


Our children are growing up here. They are in Portuguese schools, learning the language, history, and culture that make this nation unique. We see their future as Portugal’s future. We are not temporary residents; we are building legacies. We are restoring old buildings for our offices, investing in local suppliers, and bringing international teams who, in turn, rent homes, shop in local markets, and become part of their communities.


It is with this profound spirit of partnership that we wish to raise a concern. The success of any business, and the willingness to make long-term investments, depends on a stable and predictable legal environment. Recent uncertainty regarding immigration and residency laws creates significant risk, not just for us, but for the thousands of Portuguese citizens we employ and for the future investments we plan to make.


When bureaucracy becomes a bottleneck, or when the rules of residency can change unexpectedly, it makes it difficult to plan for the future with confidence. It creates anxiety for our families and for the teams we have brought here—people who have also uprooted their lives based on the promise of Portuguese stability.


This is an appeal for dialogue and collaboration. We are not asking for special treatment, but for a clear, efficient, and stable framework that allows us to continue what we came here to do: invest, innovate, create jobs, and contribute to a prosperous and dynamic Portugal.


We chose Portugal as our safe harbour and our land of opportunity. We have invested our capital, our ideas, and our families in this choice. We respectfully ask for the stability and predictability that will allow our shared investment to flourish for decades to come.


With our deepest respect and unwavering commitment to the future of Portugal,


A collective of international entrepreneurs in Portugal.

___arguments from high-risk passports 

Here are the powerful arguments for why a founder, especially one from a sanctioned or politically unstable nation, requires a Portuguese passport and not just a residence card. This is not about convenience; it's about survival and success in the global marketplace.


### 1. **De-Risking: Escaping the "High-Risk Individual" Label**


*   **The Sanctioned Passport Scarlet Letter:** A passport from a country under international sanctions (like those listed by OFAC) is a massive red flag for any financial institution. Banks, venture capitalists, and even payment processors are terrified of the legal and financial repercussions of dealing with individuals from these nations. They face severe penalties for violating sanctions, so they often adopt a zero-tolerance policy.
*   **The End of Banking as You Know It:** For a founder, this means a constant struggle to simply exist in the financial world. They can face:
    *   **Account Freezes and Closures:** Banks can and will freeze or close accounts with little to no warning.
    *   **Refusal to Open Accounts:** Opening a personal or business bank account in a major financial hub becomes nearly impossible.
    *   **Blocked Transactions:** International transfers, essential for any global business, are frequently blocked or delayed.
*   **The Portuguese Passport Solution:** A Portuguese passport instantly removes this "high-risk" label. It signals to the entire global financial system that you are a citizen of a stable, respected EU member state, and that doing business with you is safe and legal.


### 2. **Global Mobility: The Freedom to Do Business at the Speed of Business**


*   **The Residence Permit Illusion:** A residence permit is a step up, but it's not the key to the world. While it allows for travel within the Schengen Area, it does not grant global mobility. For any business with international ambitions, this is a critical limitation.
*   **The Visa Black Hole:** For a founder with a "weak" passport, every trip outside the Schengen zone means a time-consuming and expensive visa application process. This can mean missing out on crucial meetings, conferences, and opportunities. It's a constant drag on a business that needs to be agile.
*   **The Power of the Portuguese Passport:** The Portuguese passport is one of the most powerful in the world, offering visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to over 188 countries. This means a founder can:
    *   **Travel on short notice:** Seize opportunities as they arise, without being held back by bureaucracy.
    *   **Reduce costs and administrative burden:** No more endless paperwork and visa fees.
    *   **Project an image of global influence:** A powerful passport is a symbol of a founder's ability to operate on the world stage.


### 3. **Unlocking Investment: Passing the Due Diligence Test**


*   **The Founder as a Liability:** Venture capitalists are all about managing risk. When they conduct due diligence, they don't just look at the business plan; they scrutinize the founders. A founder's nationality can be a significant risk factor. Investors will ask:
    *   "Can this founder travel freely to meet with partners and investors?"
    *   "Will we have trouble wiring money to this person or their company?"
    *   "Are there any legal or political risks associated with this founder's country of origin?"
*   **The EU Passport as a Green Light:** A Portuguese passport answers all of these questions with a resounding "no." It tells investors that the founder is not a logistical or legal liability. This can be the deciding factor in securing funding, especially in a competitive environment.


### 4. **Full EU Citizenship: Beyond the Borders of Portugal**


*   **The Right to Live and Work Anywhere in the EU:** A residence permit ties you to Portugal. A Portuguese passport makes you a citizen of the entire European Union. This means you have the right to live, work, and establish a business in any of the 27 EU member states.
*   **Access to a Massive Market and Talent Pool:** As an EU citizen, a founder can tap into a market of over 450 million people and a diverse, highly skilled talent pool. This is a game-changer for any startup with ambitions to scale.


### 5. **Personal Security and Long-Term Stability**


*   **The Precariousness of Residency:** A residence permit is temporary and conditional. It can be revoked if you lose your job, your business fails, or the political winds change. For someone who has already experienced the instability of their home country, this is a constant source of anxiety.
*   **The Permanence of Citizenship:** A passport is a symbol of citizenship, a permanent and irrevocable bond. It provides the ultimate security and stability, allowing a founder to focus on building their business without the fear of being uprooted.


In short, for an international entrepreneur, a Portuguese passport is not a luxury; it's a fundamental tool for survival, growth, and success. It's the difference between being seen as a "high-risk individual" and a "global entrepreneur." It's the key that unlocks the full potential of their talent and ambition.
