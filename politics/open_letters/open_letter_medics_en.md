To: The Prime Minister of Portugal, The Minister of Health, The Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Members of the Assembly of the Republic, The People of Portugal

We, the doctors and nurses of Portugal, address you with concerns about the future of the National Health Service (SNS) in light of the new Lei da Nacionalidade project.

Our healthcare system faces a serious staffing shortage. As of January 2025, 1.56 million people lack a family doctor — this is a serious negative situation for public health.

This gap has been filled by more than 4,000 foreign medical professionals, including doctors and nurses. These are our colleagues who work with us every day. Together we save Portuguese lives. They voluntarily underwent the complex procedure of Reconhecimento Específico — to meet Portuguese standards and demonstrated a high level of Portuguese language proficiency, becoming an integral part of a healthcare service under great strain.

These professionals chose Portugal not for high salaries, but for the promise of a stable future for their families. Part of this promise was a clear five-year path to naturalization — Portugal's advantage in the global market for medical talent.

Lei da Nacionalidade changes this condition retroactively, creating a legal precedent that deeply concerns our colleagues and creates a state of profound uncertainty for them. This threatens their exodus and strikes a blow to a healthcare system that desperately needs every qualified professional.

We ask for constructive dialogue to establish a clear, predictable and stable path for those who are already here, working and contributing to Portuguese society. We propose maintaining the five-year term for medical workers already integrated into the SNS and providing them with an accelerated naturalization regime in the future. We believe such stability is necessary for the successful integration of international personnel into the SNS system.

We believe in Portugal's ability to find a fair solution that will strengthen both the SNS and trust in Portuguese institutions.

With deepest respect and hope for our shared future,

The doctors and nurses of Portugal.
