### An Open Letter to the Government and People of Portugal

**From the doctors and nurses of Portugal, united in our commitment to the National Health Service.**

**To:
The Prime Minister of Portugal
The Minister of Health
The Minister for Parliamentary Affairs
Members of the Assembly of the Republic
The People of Portugal**

We, the doctors and nurses of Portugal, write to you with grave concern for the future of our National Health Service (SNS) under the newly proposed *Lei da Nacionalidade*.

Our healthcare system is in crisis. **1.7 million people** lack a family doctor, and this crisis is deepened by an exodus of our colleagues; in recent years, **3,000 Portuguese doctors** have been forced to seek better conditions abroad.

Into this gap have stepped **6,100 international medical professionals**. These are our colleagues who work alongside us every day. They willingly undertook the demanding "Reconhecimento Específico" to meet Portuguese standards and have become an indispensable part of a health service under immense strain.

These professionals did not choose Portugal for higher salaries — they chose it for the promise of a stable future for their families. That promise was the clear, five-year path to integration. Portugal’s key advantage in a global market for medical talent. *Lei da Nacionalidade changes that* retroactively, introducing a dangerous legal precedent—that legal experts warn, and the President of the Republic has noted, may be unconstitutional.

The proposal to double this to ten years breaks that promise. This creates profound uncertainty for our colleagues, threatening to drive them away and delivering a critical blow to a healthcare system that desperately needs every qualified professional it can get. 

These are not outsiders. Their children attend Portuguese schools, growing up with your children, on Portuguese soil.

This is not a letter of demand, but an appeal for foresight. We humbly ask for a constructive dialogue to establish a clear, predictable, and stable path forward for those who are already here, working and contributing to Portuguese society. We believe that such stability is essential for successful integration and for the long-term prosperity of Portugal itself.

We place our trust in Portugal's enduring wisdom and humanity.

With the deepest respect and hope for our shared future,

The doctors and nurses of Portugal.
