# Convert Steady Parent landing to Sunstone Tales

**Date:** 2026-02-08 12:54
**Scope:** Full project rewrite — content, routes, components, branding, cleanup

## Summary
Converted the copied steady-parent Next.js landing into the Sunstone Tales brand page. Deleted all parenting-course-specific code (quiz, blog CTAs, unused landing sections), rebranded to "Sunstone Tales", rewrote content, renamed /blog to /stories, created story grid component, and added first story (Liska and Her Name).

## Context & Problem
Starting from a copy of the steady-parent Next.js landing (pro-blocks + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 + MDX), needed to strip all parenting-course content and rebuild as a children's stories brand page with: Hero, "Sounds familiar?" recognition block, and story cards grid.

## Decisions Made

### Route structure: /blog → /stories
- **Chose:** Rename route directory and update postHref() to use /stories/{category}/{slug}
- **Why:** Stories, not blog posts — matches the brand
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep /blog path — rejected, confusing for a stories brand

### Landing sections: Hero + Recognition + StoryGrid only
- **Chose:** Keep HeroSection and RecognitionSection from steady-parent, create new StoryGrid component, delete 13 other section components
- **Why:** Simple brand page, not a sales funnel — three sections is enough

### Story categories
- **Chose:** "Liska's Adventure" | "Liska's Big Feelings" with slugs liska_adventures, liska_big_feelings
- **Why:** Two types of stories — adventure and psychological/emotional

### Navbar: text logo, no CTA
- **Chose:** Plain "Sunstone Tales" text instead of image logo, two nav items (Stories, About), no CTA button
- **Why:** No product to sell, clean navigation

## Key Files for Context
- `src/app/page.tsx` — homepage composition (Hero + Recognition + StoryGrid)
- `src/content/landing/content.ts` — all landing copy
- `src/content/landing/types.ts` — TypeScript interfaces for landing content
- `src/content/blog/posts.ts` — story registry, categories, postHref()
- `src/components/landing/story-grid.tsx` — story cards grid component
- `src/content/blog/posts/liska-and-her-name.mdx` — first example story
- `src/content/pages/about/about.mdx` — rewritten about page
- `src/components/landing/navbar.tsx` — simplified navbar
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — metadata (sunstonetales.com, title, description)

## Open Questions / Future Considerations
- Railway GitHub app authorization and custom domain attachment
- R2 bucket images (hero.png, recognition.png, story covers) — using placeholders/empty for now
- About page photos still point to old steady-parent R2 bucket — migrate when new bucket has the images
- More stories to add to posts.ts registry

## Next Steps / Continuation Plan
1. Push this commit to trigger Railway deploy
2. Verify Railway build succeeds
3. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL env var on Railway
4. Upload hero/recognition/cover images to sunstonetales-media R2 bucket
5. Attach sunstonetales.com domain and configure DNS
