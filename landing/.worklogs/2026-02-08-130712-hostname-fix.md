# Fix Railway 502: bind standalone server to 0.0.0.0

**Date:** 2026-02-08 13:07
**Scope:** landing/package.json

## Summary
Next.js standalone server defaults to binding on localhost, which makes it unreachable from Railway's reverse proxy. Added `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` to the start command.

## Context & Problem
Railway deploy succeeded (build passed, server logged "Ready in 383ms") but returned 502 "Application failed to respond". The standalone server was binding to the container's internal hostname instead of `0.0.0.0`.

## Decisions Made
### Set HOSTNAME in start script
- **Chose:** `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 node .next/standalone/server.js`
- **Why:** Next.js standalone reads HOSTNAME env var to determine bind address. Railway needs 0.0.0.0.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Setting HOSTNAME as Railway env var — works but couples infra config to Railway dashboard
  - Using `--hostname` flag — not supported by standalone server.js
