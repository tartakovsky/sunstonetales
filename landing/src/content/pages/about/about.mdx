# About us


Hi! We're Eugene and Anna, ages 38 and 37 respectively.
We're based in Lisbon, Portugal.

We didn't set out to write children's stories.

<Callout variant="secondary">
**We set out to not screw up our kids the way we got screwed up.**

### Between us, we've raised three children

Eugene's two younger sisters, Sofia and Diana (now 19 and 20), and our daughter Alexandra, who's six. We're both from tech industry. And we've both spent years trying to answer one question:

<Callout>
**How do you raise a kid well when you didn't exactly get the manual yourself?**

### I'm not going to be like that
For Eugene, that question showed up early. He was a teenager, watching his parents fight and eventually divorce. They weren't too bad, but the family had issues that left marks. He remembers sitting there thinking, **I'm not going to be like that.** He started studying psychology. Life took him through doing science, then into tech and business. But the question kept nagging at him. How do you raise kids without passing down the damage?

### Huh, that's where that came from

For Anna, it hit a few years before Alexandra was born. She was deep in work with her therapist, excavating her own childhood. They'd trace a character trait back to something her parents did (or didn't do), and she'd think: **That's where that came from.** It made her realize she didn't want to parent on autopilot and hope for the best. She wanted to give her daughter what she actually needed, on purpose.

So when Alexandra came along, we had a lot of theory. Psychology research. Developmental science. Strong opinions. What we didn't have was a way to put any of it into practice at bedtime, when it actually mattered.

### We started writing stories

We wrote stories for Alexandra. Stories where the characters dealt with real things — being scared, feeling left out, not wanting to share, figuring out who you are when you're still very small. Not preachy stories with a moral stapled to the end. Just honest ones, where the feelings were real and the world was worth exploring.

We gave the stories to friends. Their kids loved them. They'd ask for "the fox one" again. And again. And the parents started noticing something — their kids were bringing up the stories during the day, using the characters to talk about things they couldn't say directly.

### So we kept going

The stories grew into a world. Sunstone City, with its warm stone walls and market squares. A snow leopard cub named Liska who's brave and curious and sometimes gets it wrong. Friends who are different from her in all the right ways.

Every story is built on developmental psychology — but you'd never know it from reading one. The science is invisible. What's visible is a kid who can't sleep, and a story worth hearing one more time.

That's Sunstone Tales.
