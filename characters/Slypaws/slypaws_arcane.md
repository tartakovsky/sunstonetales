# Slypaws' Arcane Abilities

## Arcane Abilities: The Arts of Mischief
Slypaws's abilities are a direct manifestation of his sneaky, clever, and secretive nature. They are tools for adventure and gentle chaos.

- **Function:** His powers are tangible metaphors for secrets (invisibility), "borrowing" (dimensional pockets), and accessing forbidden places (phasing). They are the engine for his role as the instigator.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Light-Bending Camouflage:** He can bend light around his body, making him nearly invisible. It requires concentration and isn't perfect; a shimmer in the air or a glimpse of his outline often betrays his position. This is perfect for his silent movements and near-misses.
  - **Dimensional Pockets:** He can create small, temporary pocket dimensions to store his "borrowed" objects. Retrieving items is an unreliable process; he often pulls out something completely different (and funnier) than what he intended.
  - **Partial Phasing:** He can become translucent and pass through solid objects for brief moments, leaving a faint trail of golden sparks. This ability perfectly complements his mischievous nature and his love for accessing places he shouldn't.
