# Tahrra's Arcane Abilities

## Arcane Ability: Shadow Weaving
Tahrra can manipulate light and shadow, using it as a tool for comfort, concealment, and communication. Her power is a direct extension of her introverted and observant nature.

**Narratively Useful Manifestations:**

- **A Bubble of Quiet:** She can create a small, perfect circle of deep, cool shadow for herself to sit in, giving her a portable space for calm concentration.
- **Helpful Shade:** She demonstrates empathy by using her ability for others, such as stretching her shadow to create a patch of cool shade for a wilting flower or a tired friend.
- **Concealment:** She can flatten her own shadow or deepen surrounding shadows to become nearly invisible, especially when she is still.
- **Visual Cue:** When she actively uses her power, her golden eyes slowly darken, becoming like pools of night, making her nearly impossible to see in the shadows she creates.
