The Emphatic Murr

A Murr is a creature that is almost entirely a tube of dense, incredibly soft fur, with no visible limbs. When it's resting, it looks like a living, breathing bolster pillow.

Appearance:
Cylindrical, about the length and thickness of a person's forearm. Its fur is naturally a soft, unassuming cream, but it is empathic, instantly changing color to reflect the emotions of those nearby—brilliant yellow for joy, deep blue for sadness, or fiery crimson for anger. Beneath the fur, a network of fine filaments creates swirling, crack-like patterns of bioluminescent light that wrap around its body. This glow is visible through the fluff and always matches the fur's current color, pulsing gently with the intensity of the emotion. At one end of the tube, two large, dark, expressive eyes and a tiny nose peek out from the fluff.

Behavior:
*   Movement: It moves by inching along like a caterpillar or by rolling sideways, creating a soft rustling sound.
*   Affection: It shows affection by coiling gently around a limb or neck and emitting a deep, resonant purring sound—the "murr"—that vibrates pleasantly.

Personality:
Extremely placid and gentle. They seek out warmth and comfort, often found coiled up in sunbeams, draped over a shoulder, or nestled among a Kashassi's tail.
