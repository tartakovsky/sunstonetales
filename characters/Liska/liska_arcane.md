# Arcane Ability: Emotional Sparks
Liska's arcane ability is a direct, uncontrollable manifestation of her inner emotional state, making her internal world visible. Her paws glow and release colored sparks that reflect her feelings.

*   **Function:** The sparks are an undeniable truth-teller. She cannot hide her anger or disappointment, forcing her and others to acknowledge her feelings directly. This often precipitates the story's central conflict or the moment of co-regulation with a parent.
*   **Colors:** The sparks match the Mood Flower colors—golden for joy, red for anger, blue for sadness.
*   **Growth (within a story):** As she works through a problem and achieves emotional balance, she can gain temporary, purposeful control over her powers, such as creating a soothing warmth to heal or controlling her sparkles. Her magic grows as her emotional understanding grows for that moment.
