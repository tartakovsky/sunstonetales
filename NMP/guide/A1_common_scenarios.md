## 5. What to Actually Say When It's Happening

You know the states. You have the tools. Now here's how to use them in the situations you're actually facing.

Each scenario includes what it looks like, why it's hard developmentally, and exactly what to do step-by-step with scripts you can use.

---

### 5.1 Scenario: Bedtime Resistance Meltdown
**Ages: 3-7 | State: Seeking Support (High Intensity)**

**What it looks like:**
It's 8 p.m. You say, "Time for bed." Your child starts crying, clinging to you, begging for "5 more minutes," and escalating to screaming, unable to calm down.

**Why it's hard:**
Transitions are neurologically difficult for young children. Going from stimulating (play) to non-stimulating (sleep) requires executive function they don't have yet. Add separation anxiety (you leave the room), and bedtime becomes a double threat.

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Regulate yourself (10 seconds)
- Remind yourself: *This is biology, not manipulation.*
- Take 2 slow breaths.
- Soften your voice before you speak.

#### Step 2: Get close and validate (1-2 minutes)
- Kneel to eye level.
- Use physical contact (a hug if they accept it).
- **Script:** "You're really upset about bedtime. You want to keep playing. I know."

#### Step 3: Set a gentle boundary (30 seconds)
- **Script:** "It's time for sleep. Your body needs rest. I'm here to help you."

#### Step 4: Offer a choice within the boundary (30 seconds)
- **Script:** "Do you want to bring your stuffed bear or your blankie to bed?"
- "Should we read one story or two?"

#### Step 5: Co-regulate through the transition (5-10 minutes)
- Stay with them through the process.
- **Script:** "We're going to walk to your room together. I'm staying close."
- Use slow movements, a calm voice, and physical touch if they want it.

#### Step 6: Use gentle narration (2 minutes)
- **Script:** "Now we're putting on pajamas. Then we'll brush our teeth. Then it's story time in bed."
- Predictability reduces fear.

**Tomorrow:** Warn them earlier about the bedtime approach. 15 minutes before, say, "Bedtime is coming soon." 5 minutes before, say, "Almost bedtime, time to finish what you're doing."

### 5.2 Scenario: Sibling Toy Conflict → Hitting
**Ages: 3-6 | State: Aggression At People**

**What it looks like:**
Two children are playing. Suddenly, there is screaming. Your older child (5) just hit the younger one (3) who grabbed their toy.

**Why it's hard:**
Sharing requires impulse control, perspective-taking ("they want it too"), and delayed gratification ("I can have it later"). Children ages 3-6 don't have these skills reliably yet. Hitting is a form of communication that says, "This is mine and I don't have words for this feeling."

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Ensure safety (5 seconds)
- Move between the children physically.
- Say calmly and firmly, "No hitting. I'm keeping you both safe."

#### Step 2: Create brief space (30 seconds)
- To the older child: "Sit here on this cushion. I'll be back in 30 seconds."
- To the younger child, offer quick comfort: "You got hit. That hurt. You're okay."

#### Step 3: Return to the aggressor QUICKLY (within 1-2 minutes)
- Kneel to their eye level.
- Use a calm presence (you're not angry at them).
- **Script:** "You hit your sister. You were SO mad she took your toy."

#### Step 4: Validate the feeling and set a boundary (1 minute)
- **Script:** "It's okay to feel angry when someone takes your thing. It's not okay to hit people."
- "Your body felt like it needed to hit. That feeling is real."

#### Step 5: Co-regulate (2-5 minutes)
- Stay close, use a soft voice.
- Wait for their breathing to slow.
- Offer physical comfort if they'll accept it.

#### Step 6: Problem-solve AFTER they are calm (5+ minutes later)
- **Script:** "When you feel that mad again, what could you do instead?"
- Offer options: "You could say 'I'm playing with that' or come get me for help."
- NOT: "Say sorry right now" (forced apologies don't teach).

#### Step 7: Apply a natural consequence (if appropriate)
- **Script:** "Your sister felt scared when you hit her. She doesn't want to play near you right now. That's what happens when we hurt people."

**Prevention for next time:**
Teach them BEFORE a conflict: "When you don't want to share, you can say 'I'm still using this' or come get me."

### 5.3 Scenario: Public Meltdown at the Grocery Store
**Ages: 3-5 | State: Seeking Support OR Aggression at Objects**

**What it looks like:**
You said "no" to candy. Your child collapses on the floor, screaming and kicking the cart, while people are staring.

**Why it's hard:**
Grocery stores create sensory overload (lights, sounds, people, stimulation everywhere). The prefrontal cortex is already taxed. A "no" to something they want leads to overwhelm. A public setting increases parental stress, making YOUR regulation harder.

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Regulate YOURSELF first (10 seconds)
- **Internal script:** *People's opinions don't matter. My child matters. They need me.*
- Take a deep breath, drop your shoulders, and ignore the stares.

#### Step 2: Get to their level (immediate)
- Kneel on the grocery store floor (yes, really).
- Use a calm, quiet voice (don't yell over their screams).

#### Step 3: Validate and stay present (1-3 minutes)
- **Script:** "You really wanted that candy. You're so disappointed."
- Offer a soft touch on their back or shoulder if they'll allow it.
- DO NOT: Try to reason, threaten consequences, or drag them away.

#### Step 4: Ensure safety if needed
- If they are kicking the cart or nearby people: "I'm moving the cart so you don't get hurt."
- Stay kneeling, stay calm.

#### Step 5: Wait
- The intensity will peak and then decline (usually takes 3-8 minutes for young kids).
- Your calm presence speeds up this process.

#### Step 6: When the crying slows (you'll see it)
- **Script:** "You're calming down. Big breaths are helping."
- "I know that was really hard."

#### Step 7: Make a gentle transition (2 minutes later)
- **Script:** "We're going to finish shopping now. Do you want to sit in the cart or walk next to me?"
- If they're very young or still shaky, pick them up, carry them, and finish quickly.

**What NOT to do:**
- Give in to avoid a meltdown (this teaches them that meltdowns get them what they want).
- Threaten: "If you don't stop, we're leaving!" (empty threats undermine you).
- Isolate: Taking them to the car alone without co-regulation teaches them, "I'm alone with my feelings."

**For next time:**
Prepare them before entering the store: "We're not buying treats today. I know that's disappointing. If you feel upset, you can tell me, and I'll help you feel better."

### 5.4 Scenario: Morning Transition Chaos
**Ages: 4-7 | State: Aggression at Objects → Seeking Support**

**What it looks like:**
It's 7:45 a.m. You need to leave for school in 15 minutes. Your child refuses to get dressed, throws their shoes, then starts crying that nothing fits right.

**Why it's hard:**
Mornings often mean low blood sugar, a tired brain, and demands on executive function (sequencing tasks, making decisions, transitioning). Clothing sensory issues are common at this age. Time pressure from a parent makes the child feel your stress, which increases their own.

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Pause and regulate yourself (10 seconds)
- **Internal:** *We might be late. That's not a crisis. They need co-regulation more than punctuality right now.*
- Breathe and slow down internally.

#### Step 2: Get to their level (immediate)
- Sit on the floor where they are.
- **Script:** "You're really frustrated. Getting dressed is hard this morning."

#### Step 3: Validate and set a boundary on throwing (30 seconds)
- **Script:** "It's okay to feel frustrated. I can't let you throw shoes. I'm putting them over here."

#### Step 4: Simplify the task (1 minute)
- **Script:** "Let's just do one thing. Can you put on your underwear? Just that. Nothing else yet."
- Break the overwhelming task into a tiny piece.

#### Step 5: Offer a choice (30 seconds)
- **Script:** "Do you want the blue shirt or the red one?"
- This restores a sense of control.

#### Step 6: Co-regulate through completion (5 minutes)
- Stay close, slow your pace, and acknowledge each small success.
- **Script:** "Underwear on, good. Now pants. Just pants."

#### Step 7: If they are still overwhelmed
- **Script:** "I'm going to help you. I'll hold the shirt, and you can put your arms through."
- Use partnership language.

**Prevention for tomorrow:**
- Lay out clothes the night before to reduce morning decisions.
- Wake up 10 minutes earlier to remove time pressure.
- Offer breakfast BEFORE dressing if low blood sugar is a pattern.

### 5.5 Scenario: Friend Conflict Aftermath, "They Don't Like Me"
**Ages: 5-7 | State: Seeking Support (Moderate)**

**What it looks like:**
Your child comes home from school crying. Their friend played with someone else at recess. They're saying, "Nobody likes me," and, "I have no friends."

**Why it's hard:**
Social awareness is increasing at 5-7 years, but perspective-taking is still developing. They can't yet understand, "My friend can like me AND play with someone else." Their brain interprets a friend playing with another kid as rejection, which means "I'm alone forever." All-or-nothing thinking is developmentally normal.

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Validate immediately (1 minute)
- Sit down and give your full attention.
- **Script:** "You're really sad. That hurt your feelings when she played with someone else."
- NOT: "You have lots of friends!" (this dismisses their current feeling).

#### Step 2: Let them talk (5-10 minutes)
- Use active listening: nod, say "mm-hmm," and reflect back what they say.
- **Script:** "So you felt left out. That makes sense."

#### Step 3: Acknowledge without fixing (2 minutes)
- **Script:** "Feeling left out is one of the hardest feelings. I've felt that way too."
- Share a brief personal example if it's relevant: "When I was little, my friend once..."

#### Step 4: AFTER they feel heard, offer gentle perspective (only when they are calm)
- **Script:** "I'm wondering, does she usually play with you, and was today different?"
- "Do you think she might still like you even though she played with someone else today?"
- Ask questions, don't make statements, to help them think.

#### Step 5: Problem-solve if they want to (5 minutes later)
- **Script:** "What could you do tomorrow if this happens again?"
- "Would it help to ask, 'Can I play too?' or find a different friend to play with?"

#### Step 6: Use future orientation (briefly)
- **Script:** "Friendships have hard days sometimes. Tomorrow might feel different."

**What NOT to do:**
- Minimize: "You're overreacting."
- Fix immediately: Calling the other parent to arrange a playdate.
- Reason too early: "Well, technically she CAN play with other kids" (this is true, but dismisses their feeling).

### 5.6 Scenario: Refusing to Leave the Playground
**Ages: 3-6 | State: Seeking Support → Can escalate to Aggression**

**What it looks like:**
Park time is over. You say, "Time to go." Your child refuses, starts crying, and might throw themselves on the ground or hit you when you try to pick them up.

**Why it's hard:**
Stopping fun feels like a loss. Young children can't hold two ideas at once, like, "This is ending AND I'll come back another time." Their brain reads "fun is over forever" as a grief response.

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Warn in advance (5 minutes before leaving)
- **Script:** "We're leaving in 5 minutes. You have time for a few more slides."
- Set a timer if that's helpful (a visual countdown).

#### Step 2: When it's time, validate preemptively (at the transition moment)
- **Script:** "I know you don't want to leave. Leaving is hard when you're having fun."

#### Step 3: If they refuse or melt down
- Kneel down, maintain a calm presence.
- **Script:** "You're really sad we're leaving. You wish we could stay longer."
- DO NOT: Argue about why you have to leave or threaten consequences.

#### Step 4: If they hit you during this
- Set a boundary: "I can't let you hit me" (block hits calmly).
- **Script:** "You're SO mad. Your body feels big. It's still not okay to hit."
- Create brief space if needed (step back 2 feet, stay visible and calm).

#### Step 5: Offer a choice (30 seconds)
- **Script:** "We are leaving. You can walk to the car or I can carry you. Which feels better?"
- Both options lead to the same outcome (leaving), but this restores a sense of control.

#### Step 6: Follow through calmly
- If they won't choose, say, "I'm going to carry you" (pick them up calmly and gently).
- **Script while carrying:** "I know you're upset. We'll come back another day."

#### Step 7: Co-regulate in the car (5 minutes)
- Let them cry if they need to.
- **Script:** "You can be sad about leaving. That feeling is okay."
- Don't lecture. Just be present.

**Prevention:**
Always give a 5-minute warning. Build in a "goodbye ritual" (wave to the playground, say "See you next time!"). This makes endings predictable.

### 5.7 Scenario: Homework Frustration, "I Can't Do It!"
**Ages: 6-7 | State: Seeking Support → Can become Aggression at Objects**

**What it looks like:**
It's homework time. Your child tries a math problem, gets it wrong, and says, "I can't do this!" They start crying and might crumple the paper or throw their pencil.

**Why it's hard:**
This involves a cognitive load, performance pressure, and fear of failure. Children ages 6-7 are developing academic skills but also have an acute awareness of "right vs. wrong answers." The brain interprets a mistake as a threat. Frustration tolerance is still developing.

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Pause the task immediately (5 seconds)
- **Script:** "Let's stop for a minute. This is feeling too hard right now."

#### Step 2: Validate and normalize (30 seconds)
- Get to their eye level.
- **Script:** "You're really frustrated. This problem is tricky. That makes sense."
- "Everyone gets stuck on hard things. Even me."

#### Step 3: Co-regulate (2-5 minutes)
- Sit next to them (not across from them, to be on the same team).
- Use a calm presence and slow breathing.
- **Script:** "Let's both take some slow breaths. We're not in a hurry."

#### Step 4: Break down the complexity (when they are calmer)
- **Script:** "Let's do this one tiny step at a time. What's the first number in this problem?"
- "Just that. Don't worry about the rest yet."

#### Step 5: Use partnership language
- **Script:** "We can figure this out together. I'm here if you need help."
- NOT: "You should know this" or "Try harder."

#### Step 6: Use process praise (when they make progress)
- **Script:** "You kept trying even when it was frustrating. That took real effort."

**Prevention:**
Build in breaks every 10-15 minutes. Offer a snack before homework, as low blood sugar can lead to low frustration tolerance. Notice their capacity that day; if they're exhausted, shorten the homework time.

### 5.8 Scenario: Screen Time Ending Meltdown
**Ages: 3-7 | State: Seeking Support OR Aggression at Objects**

**What it looks like:**
Screen time is over. You turn off the tablet or TV. Your child screams, might throw the device, hits the couch, or sobs inconsolably.

**Why it's hard:**
Screens provide high dopamine stimulation. Turning them off can feel like withdrawal, as the brain wants that stimulation back. The transition from high stimulation to low is neurologically jarring and feels like a loss.

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Warn before it ends (5- and 2-minute warnings)
- 5 minutes before: "Screen time ends in 5 minutes. Almost time to stop."
- 2 minutes before: "2 more minutes, then all done."
- Set a visible timer if helpful.

#### Step 2: When you turn it off (the transition moment)
- Use a calm, matter-of-fact tone.
- **Script:** "Screen time is over now. I'm turning it off."
- DO NOT: Apologize, negotiate, or explain excessively.

#### Step 3: Expect upset and validate (immediate)
- **Script:** "You're really mad I turned it off. You wanted to keep watching."
- Get close (kneel down).

#### Step 4: If there is aggression at objects (throwing device/hitting furniture)
- Set a boundary: "I can't let you throw the tablet. I'm putting it up high."
- **Script:** "You're SO frustrated. Your body feels big and angry."

#### Step 5: Offer a physical discharge option (1 minute)
- **Script:** "Your body has a lot of energy. Do you want to jump on the trampoline or run around outside?"
- Redirect the intensity to a safe outlet.

#### Step 6: Co-regulate through the feeling (3-10 minutes)
- Stay close, let them be upset.
- **Script:** "I'm here while you have this big feeling. It's okay to be mad."
- Be patient; the feeling WILL pass.

#### Step 7: When they are calm (10+ minutes later)
- **Script:** "That was really hard for you. Tomorrow, screen time will end again, and I'll help you with the feeling."

**Prevention:**
Use consistent limits (the same amount of screen time daily makes it predictable). Use a timer so YOU'RE not the "bad guy" (the timer says stop, not the parent). Offer an engaging alternative immediately after, like going outside or playing a game together.

### 5.9 Scenario: "It's Not Fair!" Protest
**Ages: 5-7 | State: Seeking Support (Moderate)**

**What it looks like:**
A sibling got something they didn't, or a rule applies to them but not to an older sibling. Your child is crying, yelling "It's not fair!" and won't let it go.

**Why it's hard:**
Children ages 5-7 develop an ACUTE awareness of fairness but can't yet understand that different ages mean different needs or rules. Their brain sees "they got X, I didn't" as an injustice, a threat to their place in the family. They use concrete thinking and can't grasp nuance.

**What to do:**

#### Step 1: Validate the feeling (immediate)
- **Script:** "You're really upset. It feels unfair that she got to [X] and you didn't."
- NOT: "Life's not fair, get used to it" (this is true but dismissive).

#### Step 2: Acknowledge their logic (30 seconds)
- **Script:** "You're thinking that since she got it, you should too. That makes sense to you."

#### Step 3: Give a brief explanation (only if they're calm enough)
- **Script:** "She's 8 and you're 5. Sometimes different ages mean different rules."
- "When you're 8, this rule will be different for you too."
- Keep it short; long lectures don't work.

#### Step 4: If they're still upset (1-2 minutes)
- **Script:** "I hear that you're still angry about this. That feeling is real."
- Use active listening and stay close.

#### Step 5: Use future orientation (when they are calmer)
- **Script:** "This feels really unfair right now. That feeling won't last forever."

#### Step 6: Redirect if they are still stuck
- **Script:** "I know you're upset about this. Do you want to [do an alternative activity] or stay close to me for a bit?"

**What NOT to do:**
- Over-explain or justify repeatedly (this creates a power struggle).
- Change the rule to appease them (this teaches them that protesting gets them what they want).
- Dismiss them: "You're being ridiculous."

### 5.10 The Pattern You'll Notice

Every scenario follows the same structure:
1.  Regulate yourself first.
2.  Get close and validate the feeling.
3.  Set a boundary if needed (for safety or rules).
4.  Stay present through the emotion.
5.  Problem-solve AFTER they are calm.

**This isn't a coincidence; it's the 3 R's (Regulate-Relate-Reason) applied to real life.**
