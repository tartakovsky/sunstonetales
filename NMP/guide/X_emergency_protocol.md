# Part 1: Emergency Protocol

## 1. When Your Child Is Dysregulated Right Now

Your child is screaming, hitting, throwing things, or melting down. This is called dysregulation. You need to know what to do in the next 60 seconds.

<!-- Weak -->
This is the protocol. It works because it matches how their brain actually functions.

### 1.1 The 3 R's: Regulate, Relate, Reason

---

#### Step 1: Regulate Yourself First
**Time: 30 seconds**

Before you do anything else, calm your own nervous system. A child cannot self-regulate (calm down on their own or control their emotions). They do it through your calm. A dysregulated adult cannot regulate a dysregulated child.

**Do this:**
- Take 3 slow breaths (in through nose, out through mouth).
- Drop your shoulders.
- Lower your voice tone (even if you haven't spoken yet).
- Think: *"Their brain can't handle this alone yet. They need me to be calm to calm down. This is biology, not behavior."*

**Why this matters:** Your child's nervous system reads YOUR nervous system. If you're escalated, they stay escalated. Your calm is the first step.

#### Step 2: Regulate and Relate Together
**Time: 1-10 minutes (sometimes longer, which is normal)**

Approach your child. Provide a calm presence AND validate their emotion at the same time. These happen together, not in sequence.

**Physical presence (Regulate):**
- Get to their eye level (kneel, sit).
- Move close (within arm's reach).
- Offer touch if they accept it (a hug, a hand on the back, holding a hand).
- If they pull away, stay nearby without touching; don't force contact.
- Use a soft, slow voice tone.

**Words (Relate/Validate):**
- **Name the feeling:** "You're so angry." / "That's really scary." / "You're frustrated."
- **Make it okay:** "It's okay to feel that." / "Big feelings are hard."
- **Stay simple:** "I'm here." / "You're safe." / "It is going to be fine soon."

**Examples of Regulate + Relate together:**
- Child runs to you crying → You kneel and hug them → "You're really scared. It's okay. I've got you."
- Child throwing toys → You sit nearby → "You're so frustrated right now. That's really hard."

<!-- This needs improvement -->
- Child hits you → You create space → "You're very angry. I won't let you hit me, and I'm staying close."

**DO NOT (yet):**
- Ask "why" questions.
- Lecture or explain rules.
- Give consequences.
- Problem-solve.
- Demand apologies or eye contact.

**Why:** Their prefrontal cortex (the logic brain) is offline. They cannot process reasoning. They need your calm and validation to help their nervous system return to baseline.

---

#### Step 3: Reason (When They're Calmer)
**Time: 5+ minutes after meltdown starts (sometimes 30+ minutes)**

**Wait for these signs that they're ready:**
- Breathing has slowed.
- Crying is less intense or has stopped.
- They can make eye contact.
- They respond to simple questions.

**NOW you can reason:**
- Ask what happened: "Can you tell me what was hard?"
- Problem-solve together: "What could help next time?"
- Offer choices: "Do you need more hug time or some space?"
- Set boundaries if needed: "You can feel angry. You cannot hit people."
- Repair if needed: "I yelled earlier. That wasn't okay. I'm sorry."

**Why:** Their higher brain (logic, problem-solving) is back online. Now they can learn.

### 1.2 Key Points
- **Regulate and Relate** happen together (calm presence and emotion validation).
- **Reason** happens after (when they're calm enough to think).
- Regulation time varies wildly, from 2 minutes to 2 hours (both are normal).
- Younger children mean longer regulation time.
- Your presence is the tool, not your words.
