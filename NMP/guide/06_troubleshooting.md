# Part 6: Troubleshooting - When It's Not Working

---

## 6. Common Problems and Solutions

You're trying co-regulation. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Here's why and what to do about it.

---

### 6.1 Problem: "I Can't Stay Calm When They're Screaming"

**Why this is hard:**
Your own nervous system responds to their dysregulation. Your amygdala activates (threat detection). Biologically, you're wired to REACT to a screaming child.

**What's actually happening:**
You're getting dysregulated BY their dysregulation. You can't regulate them if you're escalated.

**Solutions:**

<!-- first, deep breath, shoulders down, etc. Then, if not enough, 60 second break -->

**Immediate (in the moment):**
- Take a 60-second break if it's safe (go to the bathroom, outside, or a different room).
- Hand off to a partner if available: "I need a minute. Can you cover?"
- Do a physical reset: splash cold water on your face, shake out your body.
- **Internal script:** *Their dysregulation is not an emergency. I can handle this. Slow down.*

**Long-term:**
- Notice YOUR triggers. What situations make you lose it? (Public meltdowns? Hitting? Defiance?)
- Build your own regulation capacity through therapy, exercise, sleep, or a support system.
- Practice during low-stakes moments (when they whine about dinner, practice staying calm).
- **Reality:** You won't be calm every time. Repair when you mess up (see the "repair script" below).

### 6.2 Problem: "They Escalate More When I Stay Calm"

<!-- is that actually true? -->
**Why this happens:**
They're testing whether you'll stay steady. If your previous pattern was that you yell and then they stop (out of fear), your NEW calm confuses them. They push harder to see if you'll crack.

<!-- people don't know what extinction burst is, needs simpler words -->
**What's actually happening:**
This is an **extinction burst**. When a behavior that used to work suddenly doesn't, the behavior temporarily gets WORSE before it gets better. This is normal and expected. It means it's working.

**Solutions:**

**What to do:**
- **Keep going**; do NOT return to yelling.
- Stay calm even when the intensity increases.
- **Internal script:** *This is the extinction burst. This is temporary. Consistency builds trust.*
- **Script to child:** "I'm staying calm even though you're very upset. I'm not going anywhere."

**Timeline:**
Expect 1-2 weeks of "testing." If you stay consistent, the intensity will decrease. Inconsistency (being calm sometimes but yelling other times) makes it worse and last longer. They get confused and that dysregulates them more. Remember, children are overwhelmed most of the time and what they need the most is predictability.

### 6.3 Problem: "This Takes Forever, Punishment Was Faster"

**Why you're feeling this:**
Punishment stops behavior through fear, which gets fast results. Co-regulation builds capacity through repetition, which gets slow results.

**What's actually happening:**
You're comparing different goals:
- The goal of punishment is to stop this behavior right now (short-term compliance).
- The goal of co-regulation is to build emotional regulation capacity (a long-term skill).

**The truth:**
Punishment IS faster in the moment. But it doesn't teach regulation. It teaches children to hide their emotions, fear the adult, and comply to avoid consequences.

**Solutions:**

**Mindset shift:**
- You're not managing behavior; you're building their nervous system.
- Fast isn't always better. Effective is better.
- **Timeline:** It takes 2-4 weeks of co-regulation to see consistent changes. Stick with it.

**Realistic expectations:**
- **First week:** It will feel impossible, and you'll want to quit.
- **Weeks 2-3:** You'll see small changes (meltdowns are slightly shorter, they recover faster).
- **Week 4+:** You'll notice a difference (they start asking for help, can sometimes self-soothe).

### 6.4 Problem: "My Partner/Parents Undermine This Approach"

**Why this happens:**
Your family members see co-regulation as "too soft." They say things like, "You're spoiling them," "They need real consequences," or "We turned out fine after being spanked."

**What's actually happening:**
They're defending the methods that were used on them. Examining parenting means examining their own childhood trauma, which can be threatening.

**Solutions:**

**What you CAN control:**
- YOUR response to your child.
- Modeling co-regulation consistently.
- **Script to family:** "I'm trying a different approach based on child development research. I need you to support that, even if you don't agree."

**What you CAN'T control:**
- Their parenting opinions.
- Whether they change their methods.
- What they do when they're alone with your child.

**The reality:**
- Children adapt to different adult styles.
- Your child can learn, "Mom does it this way, and Grandma does it differently."
- **Consistency from YOU matters more than everyone agreeing.**
- Remember: it is YOUR child, your decision, and your responsibility. Whatever anyone else says is just their opinion. You have the final say.

**If your partner is the issue:**
- Share Part 2 of this guide (the brain science legitimizes the approach).
- Try co-regulation together for 2 weeks as an experiment.
- If conflict continues, consider couples therapy or a parenting coach.

### 6.5 Problem: "My Child Has ADHD/Autism/Sensory Issues, Does This Still Work?"

<!-- is that true? -->
**Short answer: Yes. It is even more important for neurodivergent nervous systems.**

**Why:**
Neurodivergent children often have:
- More intense emotional responses (bigger feelings).
- Longer dysregulation times (it takes longer to calm down).
- Different sensory needs (some want deep pressure, some want zero touch).
- Executive function challenges (it is harder to sequence "calm down" steps alone).

**Adaptations:**

**For ADHD:**
- Expect longer regulation times (15-30 minutes is common).
- Physical movement helps (let them pace, jump, or fidget WHILE you stay calm nearby).
- Keep words minimal (their processing is slower when they are dysregulated).

**For Autism/SPD:**
- Learn THEIR sensory regulation needs (deep pressure? a weighted blanket? dim lights? silence?).
- Shutdown is more common; respect their need for space while staying nearby.
- Visual supports can help (an emotion chart, a timer, pictures of coping strategies).

**For all neurodivergent kids:**
- Co-regulation is THE tool, as they need external regulation support longer and more intensely.
- Adjust the tools to their nervous system (some need more touch, some need less).
- Validation is critical, as they often get the message that their reactions are wrong.

### 6.6 Problem: "I Messed Up and Yelled/Lost My Temper. Now What?"

**You will mess up. We all do, and that's okay. You don't need to be perfect for it to work. The important part is what you do after.**

**What to do (Repair Protocol):**

#### Step 1: Regulate yourself first
- Walk away and calm down. Don't try to repair while you're still escalated.

#### Step 2: Return and name what you did
- Get to their eye level.
- **Script:** "I yelled at you earlier. That wasn't okay. I was feeling overwhelmed and I lost my calm."

#### Step 3: Take responsibility
<!-- Needs a statement first that the children can't yet control themselves and be fully responsible for their actions. It's adults responsibility to stay calm and regulate them, not their responsibility yet -->
<!-- I chose to yell because I didn't use my tools – sounds unnatural -->
- **Script:** "That was my mistake. You didn't make me yell. I chose to yell because I didn't use my tools."
- NOT: "You made me so mad that I..." (this is blaming).

#### Step 4: Acknowledge the impact
- **Script:** "When I yell, it probably feels scary. I'm sorry I did that."

#### Step 5: Make a future plan
<!-- Make it predictable for them, maintain it after -->
- **Script:** "Next time I feel that frustrated, I'm going to [walk away for 60 seconds / take deep breaths] instead of yelling."

#### Step 6: Reconnect
- **Script:** "Are you okay? Do you want a hug?"
- Offer physical reconnection if they want it. Let them go if they don't.

**Why repair matters:**
- It models how adults make mistakes, take responsibility, and repair relationships.
- It teaches that mistakes don't end a connection and models how to correct them.
- **Repairs are MORE powerful teaching moments than "getting it right."**

### 6.8 This Is Hard

Co-regulation requires:
- Regulating yourself when you're triggered.
- Staying present when you want to run.
- Repeating the same tools dozens of times.
- Patience when you're exhausted.

**You're learning skills you were never taught.**

**Your child's emotional health is worth it.**
