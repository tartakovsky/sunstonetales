# One-Page Emergency Guide**
**Use:** `01_one_page_guide.md` (as-is)
- Keep it exactly as written - pure action steps

---

# Intro
- You are here because
- What's co-regulation

# How And Why It Works 
needs to be 2 pages max, based on the current file

**Create new 2-page file by extracting from:**

2.1 What's Co-Regulation

**2.1 What's Happening in Their Brain**
- From `03_part_1_how_it_works.md` section 1.1 (Brain Development Timeline)
- Strip down to essentials: amygdala vs PFC, why they can't self-regulate
- Remove detailed age breakdowns (save for deep dive)

**2.2 How Co-Regulation Works**
- From `03_part_1_how_it_works.md` section 1.2 (first 2 paragraphs only)
- Keep: nervous system mechanism, basic developmental path
- Remove: detailed research citations (save for deep dive)

You're absolutely right - there's a mismatch. The established 3R framework is **Regulate, Relate, Reason** (not Recognize, Regulate, Reflect).

Here's the corrected table of contents structure:

---

## 3R framework: Regulate → Relate → Reason**

### Regulate: Calming the Storm**

developed by X, end-of-book footnote link

**Focus:** Physical and emotional calming during active dysregulation

**Essential tools (keep here):**
- Calm Presence (Regulated breathing/body-calming techniques)
- Intentional Connection (eye contact, proximity)
- Physical Contact (soothing touch)
- Environmental modifications (quiet space, sensory tools)

---

### Relate: Building the Bridge**

**Focus:** Emotional connection once child begins to calm

**Essential tools:**
- Emotion Acknowledgment
- Feeling Validation
- Active Listening

---

### Reason: Making Sense Together**

**Focus:** Cognitive processing after full calm

**Content:**
- When to start (timing cues that child is ready)
- The reflection conversation (age-appropriate)
- Problem-solving together
- Learning for next time
- Repair vs. punishment

## 4 Recognizing Dysregulation (4 typical states)


### **7. Implementation: Building the Practice**

**Use:** `05_implementation.md` (entire file, as-is)
- It's already well-structured
- Sections 5.1-5.4 map perfectly

---

### Common Misconceptions
- Punishment, etc

### **8. Troubleshooting**

**Use:** `06_troubleshooting.md` (entire file)
- Keep sections 6.1-6.7 as-is
- These are exactly the right problems

---

### **9. Deep Dive: The Neuroscience**

**Use:** `03_part_1_how_it_works.md` (expanded version)
- Keep ALL the detailed content you currently have
- Add back section 3.2 from `04_part_2_dysregulation_states.md` (the science)
- Add section 3.7 from `04_part_2_dysregulation_states.md` (scientific basis)
- Add diagrams, research links, detailed age progressions
- This becomes the "for nerds who want to understand everything" section

---

### **Appendix A: Common Scenarios**

**Use:** `A1_common_scenarios.md` (entire file, as-is)
- It's already comprehensive
- Sections 5.1-5.9 are perfect

---

### **Appendix B: Extended Co-Regulation Toolbox**

**Use:** `05_part_3_co_regulation_toolbox.md` section 4.3 (Additional Tools)
- All the tools you currently have in 4.3
- Organize by category as I outlined (Sensory, Movement, Creative, etc.)
- You may need to expand this section with more tools

---

### **Outro/Next Steps**

**Use:** `07_outro.md` (as-is)

---

## **Files to Drop/Merge:**

**Drop:** `03_how_to_use_the_guide.md`
- Readers don't need instructions on how to read
- The structure itself guides them
- Maybe keep 1 paragraph at the very beginning if you want

**Decision needed:** `02_introduction.md`
- Either merge into the Quick Explainer opening
- Or use as the actual book introduction before section 1
- Don't need a separate "what is co-regulation" section if you explain it in section 2

---

## **Key Structural Changes Needed:**

1. **Create new "Quick Explainer" (section 2)** by extracting essentials from `03_part_1_how_it_works.md`

2. **Create new "Reflect" section (section 6)** - currently missing

3. **Split your toolbox** - essentials stay in main guide, extras go to appendix

4. **Move all detailed science** from dysregulation states file to the deep dive section

5. **Clarify your 3R framework naming** - Regulate/Relate/Reason vs Recognize/Regulate/Reflect

Does this mapping make sense? What's unclear?
