Read the rest of the guide to learn what's happening with your child, and how to help them build emotional resilience and deep connection with you.

## Do
1) Stay calm (3 deep breaths, shoulders down, calm voice)
2) Make it safe if needed ("I can't let you hit me". Remove danger).
3) Get to their eye level (kneel, sit).
4) Offer contact (a hug. Don't force if they refuse).
5) Name and validate the emotion ("You're so angry. It's okay to feel that")
6) Wait (stay close, soft voice, active listening)

## Don't
- Discount their emotions (“There is nothing to be afraid of!”)
- Shut them up
- Lecture
- Blame
- Scream

## Do after they calmed down
