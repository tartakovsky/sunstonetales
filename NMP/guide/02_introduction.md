## You're Here Because Something Isn't Working

Your child melts down again and again.

You've tried reasoning, consequences, rewards, but nothing works. You're exhausted and doubting yourself as a parent.

Here's the truth: **You're not failing. Your child isn't broken. This is biology.** Their brain can't regulate big emotions alone yet—and there's a way to work with it.

## What's Co-Regulation

It’s simpler than it sounds.

*   To be **regulated** is when you’re in control of your emotions.
*   To be **dysregulated** is when you aren't, when your emotions overwhelm you.
*   **Self-regulation** is the ability to calm yourself down. It’s a skill that needs to be developed.
*   **Co-regulation** is when you help someone calm down by being calm and giving support. It's how you teach children to self-regulate. You lend your child your calm, acting as their emotional training wheels.
