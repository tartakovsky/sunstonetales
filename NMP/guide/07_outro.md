# 5 A Final Word

Your child isn't giving you a hard time intentionally.
Your child is having a hard time.

Their brain can't regulate emotions alone yet.
That's not a flaw; that's how humans develop.

You staying calm when they can't is how they learn to stay calm and manage their emotions.

**You're not spoiling them.**
**You're not being too soft.**
**You're teaching them that emotions are manageable and that you are safe to be around.**

That's not easy, but it's essential.
