# Section 5: Implementation - How To Actually Start

# 5. You Have the Information. Now What?

Reading this guide only gives you knowledge. To help yourself and your child you need to use it.

You're probably feeling overwhelmed with all the information. You don't need to apply it all at once. 

Here's how to move from knowing to doing without being overwhelmed.

## 5.1 First Two Weeks: Start Small

Only use emergency protocol (basic co-regulation). Ignore everything else for now.

Read it, remember it. Use it every time your child is emotionally overwhelmed. 

<!-- Very short list of actions of how to perform emergency protocol -->

That's it. Don't try to fix everything at once.

## 5.2 Track What Changes

Observe what you can and answer these questions after week 1, then week 2:

**Dysregulation duration:**
- How long do meltdowns last now vs. before you started?
- Are they getting shorter? (Even 2 minutes shorter is progress).

**Your regulation:**
- Are YOU staying calmer?
- Even one less yelling episode this week is a success.

**Child's awareness:**
- Can your child name their emotions yet? ("I'm angry" / "I feel sad").
- Are they starting to ask for help? ("I need a hug" / "I'm feeling big").

**Don't expect:**
- Zero meltdowns.
- Perfect compliance.
- Immediate transformation.

**Do expect:**
- Slightly shorter dysregulation times.
- Moments where it works beautifully.
- Moments where it fails completely (that's normal, so keep going).

## 5.3 Weeks 3-4: Build Gradually

**Add 1-2 more tools** from Section 4.

**Apply the tools to a non-emergency scenario** you face regularly.

**Notice patterns:**
- What time of day is hardest? (Being tired means more dysregulation).
- What triggers are predictable? (Transitions, hunger, overstimulation).
- Which tools work best for YOUR child?

**Adjust:**
- If some tools don't work for your kid, skip them.
- If some tools work, use them more.
- Every child is different, so adapt and trust your intuition to select from the proven tools.

## 5.4 This Is Hard. You Can Do It Anyway.

**On hard days, remember:**

❌ You're not aiming for perfect.
✅ You're aiming for better than yesterday.

❌ You won't use these tools flawlessly every time.
✅ You'll use them more often than you did before.

❌ Your child won't be "fixed."
✅ Your child will build capacity over years and they will connect with you more.

**You're building their nervous system, one co-regulation moment at a time.**
