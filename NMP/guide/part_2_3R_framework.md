# **Part 2: The 3R Framework (+ Restore)**

**Developed by Dr. Bruce Perry¹, fourth R added by Louise Bloomer2**

When your child is overwhelmed, their brain can't process logic. The thinking parts shut down. The survival parts take over. The extended 3R framework follows how your child's brain actually processes distress, from the bottom up.

## **2.1. Regulate: Calming the Body**

**What's happening:** Your child's survival brain has taken over. They're in fight, flight, or freeze. They can't learn or reflect in this state.

**What to do:** Help them calm their initial stress response. This starts working in 10-20 seconds.

1. **Regulate yourself first.** One deep breath, stay calm, steady.
2. **Get close.** Sit near them. Offer a hug or hold their hand. Your calm nervous system helps regulate theirs.
3. **Use soothing words.** Keep them limited. Soft, quiet tones. "I'm here." "You're safe."
4. **Reduce stimulation.** Soft voice. Slower movements. Dim the lights. Move to a quieter spot. No demands.
5. **Let them move.** Rocking, swaying, jumping. Movement helps.

**Don’t:** Lecture. Ask why. Explain consequences. Their thinking brain is offline.

After a few seconds, keep doing this and move on to the next step.

## **2.2. Relate: Connection and Validation**

**What's happening:** Your child is still dysregulated. You established physical connection with them, now you need to establish emotional connection.

**What to do:** Show them they're safe with you. Let them know what they are feeling. Show them there is nothing wrong with them.

1. **Notice and name the emotion.** "You're really upset." "You’re afraid."
2. **Validate feelings, not behavior.** "It makes sense you're angry." You're not agreeing with what they did. You're acknowledging how they feel.
3. **Listen actively.** If they can talk, listen. Use sounds like "mm-hmm," "I hear you." Reflect back: "So you felt left out when..."
4. **Share your own experience**. "I've felt angry like that too." Carefully and only if it's truly comparable to their situation.
5. **Stay present.** They just need you there. No fixing or solving yet.

**Remember:** This isn't negotiating or giving in, you're helping them calm down. You can re-establish boundaries and solve issues during the next step.

**When to move on:** Breathing slows. Body softens. They respond to you. Maybe they nod, talk, or lean in.

## **2.3. Reason: Understanding What Happened**

**What's happening:** They're calmer now. The thinking brain is back. They have some capacity to understand and learn, but it's still limited.

**What to do:** Help them make sense of what happened. Gently reestablish boundaries if needed.

- **Ask what happened.** Let them tell you their version. Listen.
- **Help them connect the dots.** Do this without judgment. "When you hit your brother, he got hurt and felt bad. That's why we don't hit."
- **Help them know negative emotions are normal.** "Everyone gets angry. There are ways to show it that don't hurt people."
- **If needed, help them reframe.** Sometimes they've misunderstood the situation.

**Don't:** Quiz them on solutions yet. Don't lecture. Don't pile on consequences.

## **2.4. Restore: Repairing the Harm**

**What's happening:** When dysregulated, we say or do things that cause harm. Now it's time to repair relationships and plan for next time.

**What to do:** Think together about how to fix things and reconnect with others.

- **Use the five questions:**
    - What happened? (Include thoughts and feelings)
    - Who was affected? How?
    - What needs to happen now to fix things?
    - How can we help repair the situation?
    - What could help next time this feeling comes up?
- **Repair the harm.** An apology. Helping clean up. Reconnecting with the person who was hurt.
- **Take responsibility together.** Rarely is one person fully responsible. Everyone owns their part.
- **Remember:** This doesn't mean being permissive. Boundaries stay firm. But you teach them through understanding, not shame and punishment.

**The goal:** Repair relationships, rebuild trust, and help everyone get back to learning and connection.
