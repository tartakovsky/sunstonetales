# Hook Writing Rules & Recommendations

## Foundational Principle

**The hook's only job:** Help viewers decide to opt in and continue watching by delivering topic clarity and on-target curiosity within the first 1-2 seconds.

---

## The Four Core Problems to Avoid

### 1. Delay

**Problem:** Context about the video topic is introduced too late

**Rules:**
- Introduce the topic in the first 1-2 seconds maximum
- Cut all fluff and unnecessary details from opening lines
- Maximize "speed to value" - how quickly viewers get clarity
- Remember: viewership falls off a cliff in the first 2 seconds (exponential decay)
- Every second without topic context = massive viewer loss

**What NOT to do:**
- "Guys, this is one of the craziest things I've ever seen. When you see it, you're never going to believe it."
- Vague, open-ended statements that give zero context
- Building suspense before establishing what you're building suspense about
- Starting with filler phrases or throat-clearing

**What TO do:**
- "Here are three simple ways to improve your gut health"
- "If you have gut issues, these three remedies will help you immediately"
- Use the first sentence to give context viewers need to decide whether to opt in
- Be as concise as possible while being clear

### 2. Confusion

**Problem:** Viewers don't comprehend what you're saying due to word choice or sentence structure

**Rules:**
- Write at a sixth-grade reading level
- Use fewer words, but enough that viewers can't misunderstand
- Use simpler, more common words
- Use direct active voice instead of passive voice
  - Good: "The dog jumped"
  - Bad: "The jump of the dog"
- Increase comprehension "hit rate" - the percentage of words viewers actually absorb

**What NOT to do:**
- "These guys built a $30 million empire and the online money they made is most difficult to earn if you don't develop a journaling practice like they did."
- Complex sentence structures that require re-reading
- Industry jargon or technical terms without context
- Convoluted phrasing

**What TO do:**
- "These guys built a $30 million empire and their secret for earning money online was their insane journaling practice."
- Simple, direct sentence construction
- Reorder sentences to make them easier to parse

**Clarity Testing Methods:**

1. **ChatGPT/Claude Prompt:**
   - "I've written a hook for a short form video about X topic. I need help increasing the clarity and the framing of the sentences I used. I want the meaning to be the exact same, but can you rewrite this in a sixth grade reading level so that there's no misunderstanding from the viewer?"

2. **Self-Test Question:**
   - "Is it possible for the viewer to misunderstand what I'm saying in the wrong way?"
   - "Is there more than one way these sentences could be interpreted?"
   - If yes to either: rewrite to eliminate alternative understanding paths

### 3. Irrelevance

**Problem:** Viewers don't believe the content will be valuable or relevant to them personally

**Two Primary Solutions:**

#### Solution A: Use "You/Your" Instead of "I/Me"

**Why it works:**
- Prevents viewers from questioning whether they see themselves in the creator
- Makes video feel targeted directly at them
- Eliminates possible misunderstanding about who the content is for

**What NOT to do:**
- "I've struggled with skin problems my whole life"
- Creates distance and doubt: "Do I have the same problems they do?"

**What TO do:**
- "If you've struggled with skin problems your whole life..."
- Direct address makes relevance impossible to question

#### Solution B: Frame Around Expected Value & Pain Points

**Understand the two video types:**
- **Entertainment:** Solves boredom
- **Education:** Solves a specific problem

**Rules:**
- Agitate a pain point the viewer already has
- Tee up a solution that is specifically for them
- Frame around "need to have" not "nice to have"

**What NOT to do:**
- "These are three common trends in skincare" (nice to have)

**What TO do:**
- "If you struggle with acne, try these three things" (need to have)

**Key Insight:** Learning about trends = nice to have. Solving actual acne = need to have. Always frame around the need.

### 4. Disinterest

**Problem:** Hook lacks sufficient curiosity to make viewers want to continue

**The Solution: Build a Curiosity Loop**

**What is a curiosity loop:**
- Viewer sees something → asks hypothetical question in their mind → gets context → asks new question → gets context → new question...
- The hook opens the initial curiosity loop and starts this spiral
- Creates a question in the viewer's mind that they can't look away from until answered

**The Core Mechanism: Create Contrast**

**Contrast Definition:** The distance between the viewer's current common belief (A) and your contrarian/alternative perspective (B)

**Why contrast creates curiosity:**
- A = what they know
- B = what they don't know
- B triggers the sticky pain point from A not solving their problem
- The comparison re-agitates their pain point
- This agitation creates curiosity because they want the pain solved

**The Formula:** A vs B where B solves the pain point faster, better, or cheaper than A

---

## Two Types of Contrast

### Stated Contrast (Explicit)

**Definition:** You verbally share both A and B explicitly

**Structure:** Reference baseline + contrarian alternative

**Examples:**
- "Most people solve their acne with Accutane, but I have an herbal remedy that does it three times faster"
- "Everyone says X, but actually Y"

**Characteristics:**
- More blunt
- Impossible to misunderstand
- Calls out both options directly

### Implied Contrast (Subtle)

**Definition:** You state the contrarian alternative (B) but don't explicitly reference the base (A) because it's already implied/known

**Structure:** Your solution vs. "the field" of all other options

**Example:**
- "If you want to solve your acne, this herbal supplement is eight times more effective"
- The baseline (Accutane, doing nothing, other treatments) is implied because viewers already know these options

**Characteristics:**
- More savvy and sophisticated
- Requires viewer to already know the baseline
- Less explicit but can feel smoother

**When to use which:**
- **Stated:** When baseline might not be obvious, when you want maximum clarity
- **Implied:** When the baseline is universally known, when you want elegance

## Structural Recommendations

### Hook Length & Structure

**Typical structure:** 2-3 sentences
- **Sentence 1:** Topic clarity
- **Sentences 2-3:** Set up contrast to build curiosity

**Example breakdown:**
1. "If you struggle with acne..." (topic clarity + relevance)
2. "...this herbal supplement is 8x more effective" (contrast/curiosity)

**Ideal scenario:** Achieve clarity AND contrast in a single line
- These are the most reusable hooks
- Easiest to replicate
- Most efficient

### The Complete Hook Checklist

**A winning hook must have:**

1. ✓ **Zero delay** - Topic introduced in first 1-2 seconds
2. ✓ **Maximum clarity** - Sixth-grade reading level, simple words, active voice
3. ✓ **Clear relevance** - Uses "you/your", addresses specific pain point
4. ✓ **Strong curiosity** - Creates contrast between current belief and alternative solution

**Test every hook against this:**
- Does it give topic clarity immediately?
- Is it impossible to misunderstand?
- Does the viewer believe it's for them?
- Does it create a question they need answered?

## Advanced Tactics

### Pain Point Agitation

**The principle:** Entertainment solves boredom, education solves problems. Both offer solutions to pain points.

**How to apply:**
- Identify the specific pain your target viewer has
- Reference that pain in the hook using "you/your"
- Present your solution as faster/better/cheaper than current options
- The gap between pain and solution = curiosity

### Comprehension Optimization

**Remember:** Viewers need high comprehension to decide if content is for them

**Tactics:**
- Read hook aloud - does it flow naturally?
- Remove every unnecessary word
- Replace complex words with simple equivalents
- Break complex sentences into multiple simple ones
- Eliminate passive construction

### The Retention Reality

**Typical short-form retention curve:** Exponential decay

**What this means:**
- First 2 seconds have the steepest drop-off
- Every fraction of a second matters
- Delay kills retention faster than anything else
- Speed to value is paramount

**Strategic implication:** Front-load everything valuable - topic, relevance, curiosity

## Common Mistakes Summary

### What Kills Hooks:

1. **Throat-clearing** - "So guys, today I want to talk about..."
2. **Vague teasing** - "You won't believe what happened..."
3. **Me-focused framing** - "I discovered this amazing thing..."
4. **Jargon and complexity** - Industry terms without context
5. **Burying the lede** - Taking 3+ sentences to get to the topic
6. **No contrast** - Just stating information without comparison
7. **Generic value props** - Not specific to viewer's pain point

### What Makes Hooks Work:

1. **Immediate topic clarity** - "Three ways to fix X problem"
2. **You-focused language** - "If you struggle with X..."
3. **Simple, direct language** - Sixth-grade reading level
4. **Specific pain points** - "acne" not "skin issues"
5. **Clear contrast** - "Most do X, but this does it 3x faster"
6. **Need-to-have framing** - Solutions to real problems, not nice-to-haves
7. **Active voice** - Direct, clear sentence construction

## The Writing Process

### Step-by-Step Hook Creation:

1. **Identify the topic** - What is this video actually about?
2. **Write topic clarity sentence** - Simplest possible explanation
3. **Identify target pain point** - What problem does this solve?
4. **Frame using "you/your"** - Make it about the viewer
5. **Identify the contrast** - What's the baseline vs. your alternative?
6. **Choose contrast type** - Stated or implied?
7. **Write curiosity sentence** - Build the gap between A and B
8. **Test for clarity** - Can it be misunderstood?
9. **Trim ruthlessly** - Remove every unnecessary word
10. **Read aloud** - Does it flow naturally?

### Quality Control Questions:

- **Delay test:** Does topic appear in first 1-2 seconds?
- **Clarity test:** Could this be misunderstood? Is there only one interpretation?
- **Relevance test:** Would the target viewer immediately know this is for them?
- **Curiosity test:** Does this create a question they need answered?

## Final Principles

**The 80/20:** Hooks are the single biggest lever for content performance. Master hooks, master content.

**The core psychology:** Viewers are constantly deciding whether to keep watching. Give them the information to opt in immediately, or they'll opt out by default.

**The two-part delivery:**
1. Tell them what it's about (clarity)
2. Make them care (curiosity)

**The ultimate test:** If someone sees just your hook with no other context, can they:
- Understand exactly what the video is about?
- Believe it's relevant to them personally?
- Feel compelled to see what comes next?

If yes to all three, you have a winning hook.
