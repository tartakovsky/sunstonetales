**Outreach Framework:**

1. **Personalize:** Reference specific content ("I loved your post about gentle discipline")
2. **Value alignment:** Explain why your parenting psychology guides fit their audience
3. **Clear ask:** Specify deliverables (2 IG posts + 3 Stories)
4. **Flexibility:** "If timing isn't right, we understand—parenting comes first"

**Negotiation Tips:**

- Start with their rate card but negotiate usage rights separately
- Offer volume discounts (e.g., 5 posts over 3 months)
- Bundle platforms for lower combined cost
- Discuss content ownership upfront
- Use data to justify offers (engagement rates, audience match)

**Red flags to avoid:**

- Fake followers (check engagement rate vs follower count)
- Misaligned values
- Poor content quality

### **Parenting Psychology Niche Specifics**

**What works:**

- **Expert influencers:** Child psychologists, therapists sharing evidence-based tips
- **Relatable parents:** Moms/dads documenting real behavioral challenges
- **Niche communities:** ADHD parenting, gentle parenting, anxious kids, special needs

**Content angles:**

- "How I stopped yelling using [your guide]"
- "Science-backed ways to calm meltdowns"
- "Honest review: Does this parenting course work?"

**How to find influencers**
- Instagram hashtags (#gentleparenting, #parentingpsychology)
- Influencer platforms: Aspire, GRIN, Later, Influencer Hero
- Manual search: Check followers of competitors' pages

**2. Influencers create content in their style (standard model)**

- They film, edit, and write in their authentic voice
- You provide: product, talking points, discount codes, affiliate links
- They design the posts to match their usual content
- 66% of influencers now also offer UGC (User-Generated Content) services

**When it becomes profitable:**

**Scenario A: Volume play**

- Work with 50 micro-influencers on affiliate
- 10 drive significant sales (Pareto principle)
- Those 10 each sell 20 guides/month
- 200 sales x $50 = $10,000 revenue
- Commission @ 20% = $2,000 cost
- Profit: $8,000

**Scenario B: Long-term partnership**

- Find 1 perfect-fit influencer (parenting psychologist with 50K followers)
- 3-month retainer: $500/month
- They create weekly content, Stories, newsletter mentions
- Consistent visibility = 100+ sales over 3 months
- Revenue: $5,000+
- Cost: $1,500
- Profit: $3,500+

**Real benchmarks (2025 data):**

- Average influencer marketing ROI: **4x** (spend $1, get $4 back)
- But that's averaged across all campaigns
- 30% of campaigns lose money
- 20% drive 10x+ returns
- Micro-influencers with 3%+ engagement: **2.8x higher conversion** than those below 1%

**Bottom line:**

You don't make money on single posts. You make it by:

1. Testing many influencers via affiliate (low risk)
2. Identifying the 2-3 who actually convert
3. Deepening those relationships
4. Using their content everywhere (with usage rights)

## **Commission-Only Deals: The Reality**

**Short answer: Yes, they exist but most influencers hate them.**

**Data:**

- Only **9% of creators are willing** to do commission-only
- **41% actively avoid** commission-only deals
- **54% prefer hybrid** (small fee + commission)

**Why influencers resist:**

- No guaranteed income = high risk
- They put in work (filming, editing) with zero pay if it doesn't convert
- Your product might suck at converting even if their content is good
- Their rent doesn't wait for your sales

**Who accepts commission-only:**

- **Nano-influencers** (1K-10K followers) building portfolios
- Influencers who genuinely love the product
- Those already making money from other brand deals

**How to make commission-only work:**

1. **Sweeten the deal:**
    - Higher commission: 25-30% instead of 10-15%
    - Free product/full access to all your guides
    - Exclusive early access to new content
    - Performance bonuses: "Hit 50 sales, get $200 bonus"
2. **Prove it converts:**
    - Show them testimonials
    - Share conversion data from your site
    - Give examples of other creators who earned $X
3. **Start small:**
    - "Try posting 1 Story first, see if it resonates"
    - Low commitment = easier yes

**Realistic approach for you:**

- **Nano/micro (under 20K):** Offer commission-only with good terms (25% + free guides)
- **Mid-tier (20K-100K):** Hybrid ($100-200 flat + 15% commission)
- **Larger:** They'll demand flat fees ($500+), probably not worth it for you yet

## Standard Process to Approach Influencers

### Step 1: Check if They Do Sponsored Posts

**Look for these signs on their Instagram:**

**Clear indicators:**
- **"Paid partnership with [Brand]"** label on posts (official Instagram disclosure)
- **#ad, #sponsored, #partner** in captions
- Posts mentioning discount codes or affiliate links
- Stories with swipe-up links to products
- Captions like "Thanks to @BrandName for sending me..."

**Where to check:**
1. Scroll their recent posts (last 20-30)
2. Look at their Stories highlights for brand collabs
3. Check if they tag brands frequently
4. Use tools like **Modash** (tracks all sponsored posts automatically)

**Bio indicators:**
- Email in bio = open to business
- "Collabs: email@example.com" = actively seeking deals
- Link to media kit/rate card
- Management agency contact

**If NO signs of sponsorships:**
- They might be brand new to it (opportunity!)
- They might do it but haven't disclosed properly (sketchy)
- They might not be interested (move on)

### Step 2: Find Contact Method

**Priority order:**
1. **Email in bio** → Use email (more professional, detailed)
2. **"DM for collabs"** → Use Instagram DM
3. **Nothing listed** → Try DM first, then email if you find it

**Finding emails:**
- Check bio
- Check website/Linktree
- Google their name + "contact"
- Use tools: Hunter.io, Modash Chrome extension

### Step 3: Initial Outreach (DM or Email)

**Instagram DM Template (Casual, for micro/nano):**

### Step 4: What to Include in First Message

**Must-haves:**
1. **Personalization** - Reference their actual content (NOT "I love your page")
2. **What you offer** - Product + what's in it for them
3. **What you want** - "1 Reel + 3 Stories" (be specific)
4. **Next step** - "Interested?" or "Can I send more info?"

**Keep it SHORT:**
- DM: 3-4 sentences max
- Email: 5-7 sentences max

### Step 5: Follow-Up Process

**If no response:**
- **Wait 3-7 days**
- Send ONE follow-up: "Hey! Just checking if you saw my message. Still interested in collaborating?"
- If still no response → **move on**

**Don't:**
- Send multiple messages
- Get pushy
- Take it personally (they get 50+ pitches/week)

### Step 6: Once They Respond

**If interested:**
1. Share more details (brief, deliverables, timeline)
2. Ask for their rates or share your offer
3. Negotiate if needed
4. Send formal agreement/contract
5. Ship product or send access

**If they ask for rates/media kit:**
- They're serious about sponsored content
- Review their stats (engagement rate, audience demographics)
- Decide if it fits your budget

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Skip these influencers:**
- Bought followers (high count, low engagement <2%)
- All their posts are #ad (audience is burnt out)
- No email/contact info anywhere (not serious)
- Fake engagement (comments like "Nice!" "Great!" with no substance)

### Tools to Speed This Up

**Free:**
- Instagram search + manual scroll
- Google Sheet to track outreach
- Gmail templates for emails

**Paid (worth it at scale):**
- **Modash** - See all past sponsored posts, emails, stats ($99/mo)
- **SARAL** - Automate outreach + tracking ($299/mo)
- **Aspire/GRIN** - Full influencer management ($$$$)

### Realistic Expectations

**Response rates:**
- Cold DMs: 10-20% reply
- Cold emails: 5-15% reply
- Of those, 30-50% will actually convert to deals

**Translation:** Reach out to 50 influencers → 10 respond → 3-5 sign deals

**This is normal.** It's a numbers game at first. Once you build relationships, repeat collabs get easier.

**Collabstr/Afluencer:**

- 70% micro/nano (good engagement, learning the ropes)
- 20% mid-tier (solid, professional)
- 10% mediocre/fake followers

**The real pros (50K+):**

- Usually NOT on marketplaces
- Have email in bio, you contact directly
- Charge premium rates ($500-2,000+)


### **Paid campaigns:**

- **4 posts per month** = industry standard for ongoing partnerships
    - 2 feed posts (permanent)
    - 2-4 Stories (24hr)
- Cost: $400-600/month for micros

### **Solution 1: Start with Commission-Only (Zero Testing Cost)**

Instead of paying $800 to test an influencer, you:

1. **Offer commission-only:** "25% commission, here's your affiliate link"
2. **Give them free access** to review the product
3. **Let them post however much they want**
4. **Track who actually sells**

**Cost to test 50 influencers:** $0 upfront

**Results:**

- 40 influencers: Post once, sell nothing, ghost you
- 7 influencers: Post 2-3 times, sell 5-10 copies each
- 3 influencers: Post regularly, sell 20+ copies

**Then you:**

- Ignore the 40 who didn't perform
- Pay commission to the 10 who sold
- Offer the top 3 a hybrid deal: "$300/month retainer + 20% commission for 8 posts/month"

**Total testing cost:** $0 (only pay commission on actual sales)

---

### **Solution 2: Stories-Only Testing (Cheap Volume)**

**Instead of:**

- $100-150 for 1 feed post
- Testing one influencer at a time

**Do this:**

- $20-40 for Instagram Stories (24hr content)
- Test 20 influencers for $400-800
- See who drives clicks

**Why Stories work for testing:**

- Cheaper (1/5th the price of feed posts)
- Faster (24hr, no permanent commitment)
- Link in Stories = direct traffic tracking
- If it converts, THEN invest in feed posts

**Testing 50 influencers:**

- 50 x $30 (Stories) = $1,500
- Find 5-10 that drive clicks/sales
- Invest in multi-post campaigns with those 5-10
