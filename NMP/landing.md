---

## SECTION 1: HERO (Above Fold)

### Headline Options:

**Option A:**
"When Your Child's Big Emotions Take Over the Whole House"

**Option B:**
"Your Child's Meltdowns Aren't Failures - And You're Not Failing"

---

### Subheadline:
"Learn the science-backed approach that helps children ages 3-7 manage feelings while keeping your own calm intact"

---

### Emotional Validation Block:
- You're exhausted from meltdowns that come from nowhere
- You know punishment didn't work for you, but don't have the tools to do it differently
- You've tried reasoning, consequences, rewards - nothing sticks
- You lose your temper, then feel guilty for days

---

### Visual:
Parent at eye-level with upset child, moment of connection (not mid-crisis)

---

## SECTION 2: RECOGNITION (Not Agitation)

### Headline:
"You Recognize This..."

### Content:
Your child melts down over things that seem small to you

They struggle with transitions, sharing, frustration, disappointment

You wonder: "Are they manipulating me?" "Am I too soft?" "Will this ever get better?"

You're tired of family members saying you should "just be firmer"

Time-outs don't teach regulation. Punishment teaches fear. "Because I said so" builds resentment. You need tools that actually match how children's brains develop.

**The truth? Their brain literally can't handle these feelings alone yet.**

This isn't about your parenting. It's not about their character. It's about development.

---

**Tone:** Validation + Science teaser  
**Goal:** Recognition without dwelling on pain, quick pivot to hope

---

## SECTION 3: AUTHORITY + CONCEPT

### Headline:
"Meet Co-Regulation: The Missing Piece in Child Development"

### Visual Element:
Simple infographic showing:
Adult's calm nervous system → helps → Child's developing nervous system → builds → Child's future self-regulation

### Content:
Co-regulation is how children ages 3-7 learn to manage emotions. They literally cannot do it alone yet - their brain development won't allow it.

Your calm teaches their calm. Your presence builds their capacity. This is temporary - they're learning.

**Created by child psychologists who understand:**
- Ages 3-7 are critical for emotional development
- Children CAN'T self-regulate yet (it's biology, not behavior)
- Co-regulation isn't permissive - it's developmental
- You're not spoiling them, you're building their nervous system

**Credentials:**
PhD child psychologists • Research-backed • Used by 10,000+ families

---

## SECTION 4: TRANSFORMATION (Before/After)

### Format: Two-column comparison

**WITHOUT CO-REGULATION** → **WITH CO-REGULATION**

Constant battles → Cooperation through connection

"They never listen!" → They feel understood

React with anger → Respond with presence

Everyone dysregulated → You're the calm anchor

Guilt cycle → Confident parenting

"Fix" behaviors → Support development

---

**Note below:**
"Works for bedtime battles, sibling fights, school transitions, public meltdowns, and more"

---

**Card 2: Video testimonial (15 seconds)**
"My 5-year-old used to have 3+ meltdowns daily. Now she can tell me 'Mom, I need help calming down.' Game changer."

### Outcome Statement:
"You'll raise a child who can manage emotions, not just hide them. Who respects you because you earn it, not because you demand it. Who builds emotional capacity that lasts a lifetime."

---

## SECTION 7: OBJECTION HANDLING

### Headline:
"Common Questions We Hear:"

### Q&A Format:

**"Won't this make them dependent on me?"**
No. Co-regulation BUILDS independence. You're teaching skills they'll internalize. Think of it like learning to ride a bike - you hold the seat until they can balance alone.

**"I can barely regulate myself"**
That's exactly why we start with YOUR regulation first. Module 2 teaches you the tools for yourself before applying them with your child.

**"My family will say I'm too soft"**
They'll say "just be firmer" or "we turned out fine." Here's the truth: you're not raising their opinions. You're raising a child who won't spend their twenties in therapy unpacking their childhood.

**"What if my partner doesn't agree?"**
Module 5 includes the co-parent alignment guide - how to get on the same page without fighting about parenting styles.

**"My child is strong-willed/sensitive/intense"**
Co-regulation works for ALL temperaments - including neurodivergent kids. The approach adapts to your child, not the other way around.

**"What if it doesn't work for us?"**
30-day money-back guarantee. If this doesn't give you actual tools you can use, we refund you. No questions asked.

---

## SECTION 8: URGENCY (Developmental, Not Manipulative)

### Headline:
"Your Child's Brain Is Developing Right Now"

### Content:
Ages 3-7 are the critical window for building emotional regulation skills.

Every big emotion moment is a learning opportunity - either they're learning regulation with your help, or they're learning their emotions are something to hide or be ashamed of.

The patterns you establish today shape their stress responses for life.

Which pattern do you want them to internalize?

---

## SECTION 10: FAQ

**"What if my child has ADHD/autism/SPD?"**
Co-regulation is especially helpful for neurodivergent children. The approach is flexible and works with different nervous systems.

**"Can I use this with multiple kids at different ages?"**
Yes. The guide focuses on ages 3-7, but the principles work for younger and older siblings too. You'll learn to adapt by developmental stage.

**"How long does it take to see results?"**
Most parents report seeing changes within 2 weeks. Some situations improve immediately once you have the emergency protocol.

**"What if I mess up and yell?"**
You will. That's normal. The guide includes repair strategies - how to reconnect after you lose your cool. You're not aiming for perfect.

**"Is this different from gentle/positive parenting?"**
Co-regulation is the science behind why gentle approaches work. It's specific, developmental, and gives you the actual mechanisms - not just "be nice."

**"Do I need a psychology background?"**
No. Everything is explained in parent language with real examples. If you can follow a recipe, you can follow this.
