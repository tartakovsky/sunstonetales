# Liska Stories — Psychological Story Specifics

Each story focuses on one specific developmental struggle common to ages 4-6 — a fear, a problematic behavior, a difficult emotion, a social challenge. The series as a whole aims to cover the full range of what children this age face. But these are stories first — engaging, dramatic, edge-of-your-seat narratives that happen to be built around a developmental challenge. Not SEL worksheets dressed up as fiction.

## Emotional Arc

The general shape follows a progression: an engaging, fun opening that establishes the world and characters warmly → a situation brings up a difficult emotion or challenge → early attempts to cope don't work → things get harder before they get better → support and discovery lead to a new way through → growth is demonstrated through action → a brief, warm closing that leaves the reader with a sense of resolution.

This isn't rigid — adapt the pacing and shape to fit the story. The challenge can belong to any character, not only Liska. Support can come from parents, friends, or the situation itself.

## Developmental Psychology

These stories showcase good developmental practices for both children and adults in emotionally difficult situations. Each story is an opportunity to model a different facet — how to support a struggling child, how to navigate a new emotion, how to recover from a setback. The psychology should feel real and earned, never clinical or instructional.
