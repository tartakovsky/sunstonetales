# Liska Adventures — Characters

## Liska [RU: Лиска]

Anthropomorphic snow leopard, ~5 years old, the protagonist. White fur with silver-gray spots, warm brown eyes. Originally from the snowy mountains of Sar-Gora, now lives in Sunstone City (Сарабад) on the coast. Parents: Mara (mother) and Daric (father).

**Personality:** Curious, bold, and impulsive — she leaps before she looks. Feels everything big, bounces back fast.

**Expressiveness:** Full human-like emotional expressions, plus animal features on top — an extremely expressive tail, ears that move with her mood, fur that puffs up in big moments.

**Pet names:**
- EN: kitten, baby, little leopard, Snowflake, Little One, Fluffy
- RU: котенок, малышка, Лисонька, барсенок, пушистик, пушок
- Father uses: котенок, малышка, Лисонька, пушистик
- Mother does NOT use: пушистик

## Anji [RU: Анжи]

Anthropomorphic Siamese-Bengal cat, ~5 years old, Liska's friend. Cream fur with dark brown points, bright blue eyes, sleek and always in motion. Wears a short dark cape.

**Personality:** Boundless energy, good-natured. No volume control — his whisper is a stage-whisper yowl. Zero concept of personal space. Acts first, thinks much later. His feelings are 100% on the outside.

## Tahrra [RU: Тарра]

Anthropomorphic black panther, ~5 years old, Liska's friend. Glossy black fur, striking golden eyes. Wears an orange-and-purple asymmetrical dress. Moves with quiet, deliberate grace.

**Personality:** The quiet observer. Communicates more through actions and drawings than words. Sees patterns and details nobody else notices. Carries a small notebook where she records facts. When she speaks, it's to state a simple truth that cuts through everything — childlike wisdom that sees right through the nonsense. Deadpan delivery.

## Secondary Characters

### Mara [RU: Мара]

Liska's mother. Snow leopard, white fur with decorative shells and braids. Nurturing but firm, a clever problem-solver. Painter. Can find anything.

### Daric [RU: Дарик]

Liska's father. Snow leopard, larger with thicker fur. Patient and supportive with Liska, always ready to explain. Irreverent, analytical, overly rational. Harshly protective of his personal boundaries — takes zero nonsense from adults.

### Lucia [RU: Люсия]

Human, ~5 years old. The only human character. Doesn't speak the local language fluently — communicates through broken speech with a Latin flavor, expressive gestures, and sheer enthusiasm. Action-oriented and physically brave. Signature words: "Friendus!", "Maximus!" Her language barrier is a strength, not a weakness — she connects through action and warmth.

### Slypaws [RU: Хитролап]

Anthropomorphic ermine, small and nimble. White fur, mischievous gleaming eyes, crooked smile. The lovable rogue — driven by the thrill of secrets, hidden places, and forbidden doors. "Indefinite borrower" of interesting objects ("It looked lonely"). Frames small mischief as grand conspiracies in dramatic whispers. Never malicious, always mischievous. His long tail is secretly named "Whisper."

### Zanziri [RU: Занзири]

Anthropomorphic black panther, Tahrra's mother. Collected, calm, with a quiet menace underneath. Moves like someone who could be very dangerous but chooses not to be. Fiercely protective of children. Speaks little, and when she does, people listen.

### Kebab Man [RU: Шашлычник]

Big, fat, loud, friendly cat. Runs a kebab stand. Family friend — Liska adores him. Source of money-related comedy (Liska trying to buy things, negotiate prices, understand commerce).

### Lynx Cub [RU: Рысёнок]

Small lynx, younger than Liska. Shy and easily frightened — the kind of kid who hides behind things and peeks out with one ear. Liska's instinct to protect and encourage him brings out her bravest side. Bounces back once someone shows him the way.

### Caterpillow [RU: Котусеница]

A Murr — a limbless tube of incredibly soft fur with two big dark eyes peeking out. Moves by inching like a caterpillar or rolling sideways. Empathic: its fur and bioluminescent glow change color to match the emotions of those nearby (biological, not magical). Shows affection by coiling around a limb and purring — the "murr." Extremely placid and gentle.

### Mood Flowers

Flowers that visually reflect emotions through color and shape (biological, not magical). Part of the world's natural landscape.

### Slothy [RU: Ленивчик]

Liska's favorite plush toy sloth. A comfort object she carries around.
