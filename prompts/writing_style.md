# Liska Stories — Writing Guide

## Story Identity

Stories for children aged 4-6, read aloud by parents. They can be adventure stories, emotionally-focused stories, or both. All stories are grounded in developmental psychology for ages 4-6 and follow best practices — children drive solutions, emotions are validated not dismissed, consequences are natural not punitive, growth is shown through action not explained through dialogue.

Every story should strengthen the bond between the parent reading and the child listening. Showcase warm, real relationships — moments that make them want to be closer. See `adventure_story.md` and `psychological_story.md` for type-specific guidance.

## Prose Style

- 3rd person, past tense. Show, don't tell.
- Write from a child's perspective — small things feel huge. A puddle is an ocean, a high shelf is a mountain. Problems should be real from a child's eye level.
- Write natural, idiomatic language — the way people actually speak to children. It should flow when read aloud.
- Vary sentence length for rhythm. Use simple connectors (and, but, so, then) for flow.
- ~10% of vocabulary can be slightly advanced words that expand the child's language through context. The rest should be simple and common for 4-6 year olds.

## Format

- **Total length**: ~700 words per story.

## Humor & Fun

The stories should be genuinely funny for both children and adults. Some things to keep in mind, you don't need to always follow them:

- Exaggeration and physical comedy — full-body reactions to small things, dramatic overreaction.
- Absurd similes and comparisons, the weirder the better.
- Child-logic — flawless reasoning from incorrect premises, literal interpretations of figurative speech.
- Dry and wry humor and understatement, irony.
- Invented words, neologisms, creative mispronunciations, naming things by function.
- Child-like word mangling.
- Sound effects and onomatopoeia.

## Forbidden Tropes

- No magic fixes or instant emotional resolution. Problems are solved through effort.
- No passive protagonists. Children drive the action.
- No adult lectures or teaching monologues. Max 1-2 sentences of adult guidance at a time.
- No static scenes. Every scene advances plot or develops character.

## Translation & Cultural Adaptation

Stories are written in English first, then adapted (not literally translated) into Russian. The Russian version should feel native — idiomatic, culturally natural, with the same emotional impact but adapted expressions, names, and cultural references. Prioritize meaning and feel over word-for-word accuracy.

**Dialogue formatting:**
- **English**: Double quotes. Punctuation inside quotes. `"Let's go," said Liska.`
- **Russian**: Em-dash, no quotation marks. `— Пойдём, — сказала Лиска.`

**Internal thoughts:**
- **English**: Italics, no quotes. `*I can do this*, she thought.`
- **Russian**: Guillemets. `«Я смогу», — подумала она.`

## World & Setting

The stories take place in a low-fantasy, late-medieval world. No magic, no anthropomorphism of inanimate objects. See `setting.md` for details.

## Characters

Characters are age-appropriate (4-6 audience). Distinct personalities, redeemable antagonists, diversity without making it the point. See `characters.md` for the cast.
