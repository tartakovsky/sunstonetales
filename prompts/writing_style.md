# Liska Adventures — Writing Guide

## Story Identity

Liska Adventures are adventure stories for children aged 4-6, read aloud by parents. Each story combines a physical adventure (quest, exploration, problem to solve) with an emotional thread that emerges naturally from the journey. Liska feels emotions naturally but moves through them quickly — she's the one who notices and helps others with theirs. Distribute emotional weight across the cast, not just the protagonist. The deeper emotional threads come from friends, situations, or the people they meet along the way.

## Story Structure

Use established adventure story structures as a foundation — Hero's Journey, quest narratives, three-act structure, or similar proven frameworks. Don't invent rigid systems; pick what fits the story. The key requirements:

- Forward momentum. Every scene moves the adventure forward.
- Tension, mystery, and foreshadowing to keep attention.
- Cliffhangers between story segments for read-aloud pacing.
- Each story has both a physical goal (find something, get somewhere, solve a problem) and an emotional dimension that emerges naturally from the adventure.
- Theme emerges from action, never from lectures.

## Developmental Psychology Layer

These are adventure stories grounded in developmental psychology for ages 4-6. Emotional learning happens through modeling — characters demonstrate healthy ways to navigate situations naturally, not because the plot forces a lesson. Follow best practices from developmental psychology: children drive solutions (adults guide, not fix), emotions are validated not dismissed, consequences are natural not punitive, and growth is shown through action not explained through dialogue. This layer should be present but invisible — woven into good storytelling, never didactic.

## Prose Style

- 3rd person, past tense. Show, don't tell.
- Write from a child's perspective — small things feel huge. A puddle is an ocean, a high shelf is a mountain. Problems should be real from a child's eye level.
- Write natural, idiomatic language — the way people actually speak to children. It should flow when read aloud.
- Vary sentence length for rhythm. Use simple connectors (and, but, so, then) for flow.
- ~10% of vocabulary can be slightly advanced words that expand the child's language through context. The rest should be simple and common for 4-6 year olds.

## Format

- **Total length**: ~700 words per story.

## Forbidden Tropes

- No magic fixes or instant emotional resolution. Problems are solved through effort.
- No passive protagonists. Children drive the action.
- No adult lectures or teaching monologues. Max 1-2 sentences of adult guidance at a time.
- No static scenes. Every scene advances plot or develops character.

## Translation & Cultural Adaptation

Stories are written in English first, then adapted (not literally translated) into Russian. The Russian version should feel native — idiomatic, culturally natural, with the same emotional impact but adapted expressions, names, and cultural references. Prioritize meaning and feel over word-for-word accuracy.

**Dialogue formatting:**
- **English**: Double quotes. Punctuation inside quotes. `"Let's go," said Liska.`
- **Russian**: Em-dash, no quotation marks. `— Пойдём, — сказала Лиска.`

**Internal thoughts:**
- **English**: Italics, no quotes. `*I can do this*, she thought.`
- **Russian**: Guillemets. `«Я смогу», — подумала она.`

## Characters

Characters are age-appropriate (4-6 audience). Distinct personalities, redeemable antagonists, diversity without making it the point. See `characters.md` for the cast.
