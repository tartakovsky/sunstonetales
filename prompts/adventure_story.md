# Liska Stories — Adventure Story Specifics

Adventure stories — quests, explorations, problems to solve. Each story combines a physical adventure with an emotional thread that emerges naturally from the journey.

## Story Structure

Use established adventure story structures — Hero's Journey, quest narratives, three-act structure, or whatever fits. Don't invent rigid systems; pick what fits the story. The key requirements:

- Forward momentum. Every scene moves the adventure forward.
- Tension, mystery, and foreshadowing to keep attention.
- Cliffhangers between story segments for read-aloud pacing.
- Each story has both a physical goal and an emotional dimension that emerges naturally.
- Theme emerges from action, never from lectures.
- Reader engagement and immersive interaction that don't break the fourth wall.

## Emotional Distribution

Liska feels emotions naturally but moves through them quickly — she's the one who notices and helps others with theirs. Distribute emotional weight across the cast, not just the protagonist. The deeper emotional threads come from friends, situations, or the people they meet along the way.

## Developmental Psychology

The developmental psychology layer should be present but invisible — woven into good storytelling, never didactic. Characters model healthy ways to navigate situations naturally, not because the plot forces a lesson.
