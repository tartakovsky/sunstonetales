# Liska Adventures — Setting

## World

Low-fantasy, late-medieval world. No magic, no anthropomorphism of inanimate objects. Inhabitants are anthropomorphic animals (Kashassi) — human-like people in animal form. Some humans too, episodically. Tropical coastal climate.

## Sunstone City [RU: Сарабад]

A coastal city where Liska's family lives. The cultural vibe is Eastern — think Thousand and One Nights but less specifically Arabic. Open markets, floor-sitting, spiced food, communal courtyards, ornate sandstone architecture with carved-wood balconies and lattice windows with colored glass. Dense tropical jungle presses up against the city. The sea is calm and turquoise.

Liska's family are immigrants from Sar-Gora, a cold, snowy mountain region far away. Sar-Gora has a more Western/Northern feel — think Siberia with Western European touches. The family carries some of that culture with them.

## Culture

- Floor-sleeping tradition — thick rugs, cushions, low tables, no beds or chairs
- Communal courtyard living — inward-facing houses, shared spaces, collective watchfulness
- Market as social hub — haggling, socializing, spice-heavy cooking culture
- Curtains instead of doors inside homes
- Rounded organic architecture — curved walls, no sharp corners in children's spaces

## Key Locations

**The Yard** — Residential compound of 10-12 houses arranged in a polygon around a central well. Four archway gates lead to the market, the beach, the jungle, and the north quarter. The playground is in one corner. This is Liska's daily world — small for adults, epic for a child.

**The Beach** — Golden sand meeting calm sea, bordered by jungle and low sandstone cliffs. Grottos, tide pools, hidden alcoves for exploration.

**The Jungle** — Dense, real tropical forest right next to the city. Minimal stone paths, one clearing. Genuine wilderness — vines, thick canopy, humid air, animal sounds.

**The Market** — Open plaza with freestanding stalls under colorful awnings. Thick with the smell of cinnamon, grilling meat, and tropical fruit. Where Kebab Man has his stand.

**The Summer Camp** — Deeper in the jungle, tents around a small lake. A child's first taste of real independence.

**Liska's Home** — Warm golden clay-brick walls, oil lamps in wall niches, a large monstera plant in Liska's room. The main room has low tables and floor cushions. The kitchen has a stone hearth and copper pots hanging from ceiling beams.
