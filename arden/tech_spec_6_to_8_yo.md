# Technical & Structural Requirements for Children's Stories

## Target Audience
- **6-8 year old children** - Use language complexity appropriate for 7-year-olds.

## Document & Page Structure
- **Total Text Length**: 1000-1600 words.

Stage 2: Ages 6-8 (The Early Reader / Early Chapter Book Stage)
This is the sweet spot for your 64-page format.

Book Format: 64-page books, often called "early readers" or "first chapter books." They have more text, are broken into short chapters, but still rely heavily on illustrations.
Reading Context: Transitioning from being read to, to reading with a parent, to reading alone. The text must be compelling enough to make the effort of decoding words feel rewarding.
Character Development: Introduction of the "Mini-Arc."

This is not a fundamental personality change. Instead, it's a visible skill or confidence progression over a short series (e.g., 3-4 books). The character doesn't have to remember everything, but the reader starts to see tangible growth.
This is highly "structurizable" for you as a writer.



Examples of a "Mini-Arc" for a 6-8 Year Old Character:


Skill-Based Arc:

Book 1: A character is terrified of learning to ride a bike. Lots of falling. Ends with them still needing training wheels but feeling a little braver.
Book 2: The training wheels come off. There's a big fall, and they want to quit. A parent or friend helps them see that falling is part of learning.
Book 3: They try again and finally succeed, riding on their own for the first time. The series concludes with the character having mastered a new, concrete skill.



Social-Emotional Arc:

Book 1: A character moves to a new town and is too shy to talk to anyone at the park.
Book 2: They have a brief, awkward interaction with another child over a shared interest (e.g., dogs, a specific toy).
Book 3: They purposefully seek out that child and successfully initiate playing together, forming the beginning of a friendship.



Why this works at 6-8: Children now have better memory and a stronger sense of linear time. They are beginning to see themselves as people who learn and grow, so seeing a character do the same is deeply resonant and validating. It mirrors their own experience in school.




# TODO: Re-calculate the below later.

- **Page Word Count**: 20-30 words per page.
- **Page Sentence Count**: 2-4 sentences per page.
- **Format**: Each line of text in the draft represents one page. Do not use page numbers.

## Sentence & Vocabulary Rules
- **Sentence Length**: 5-10 words per sentence.
- **Tense**: 3rd person past tense.
- **Vocabulary**: Primarily nouns and verbs.
- **Adjective Rule**: Use only simple, concrete adjectives a 5-year-old understands (e.g., big, red, happy). Avoid abstract or multi-syllabic adjectives.
