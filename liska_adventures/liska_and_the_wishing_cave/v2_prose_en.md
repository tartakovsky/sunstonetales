# The Crystal Cave

Today, Liska, Anji and Tahrra went to the Crystal Cave.

Children in Sunstone City came here to make wishes. You drew your hope on a leaf, folded it tight, and wedged it into one of the cracks that lined the cave mouth. The wind hummed through the crystals and carried your wish deep inside the mountain.

Liska placed hers carefully — a small leaf with a drawing of her family, tails tangled together. She pressed it in with one finger and held her paw there for a moment.

A small lynx cub nearby stood on his toes, reaching for a crack above his head. His leaf was folded so many times it was barely bigger than a pebble. He stretched, stretched — and a gust of cave-breath snatched it from his fingers.

The leaf tumbled into the dark.

He reached after the leaf, but missed. His mouth wobbled. His eyes filled up, and a small *nnn* squeaked out of him.

"I'll get it," Liska said.

"We'll ALL get it," Anji said. Tahrra nodded.

Liska grabbed Anji's paw, Anji grabbed Tahrra's, and the three of them stepped into the dark together.

At first they couldn't see their own paws. But as they went in, the cave started to glow. Soft pink lights here. Little purple ones there...

"There!" Anji pointed. The leaf sat on a ledge just ahead.

Liska reached for it... but another gust rolled through the tunnel and the leaf skittered deeper into the passage.

They chased it around a bend, down a slope, past walls where the crystals grew thick as fur. The humming faded. The air went still and cool and smelled like wet stone.

They took one more step, and the ceiling went way up high, the walls moved away and the tunnel turned into a big, wide room.

Anji's tail bumped Liska's shoulder. "We're pretty deep," he whispered. "DEEP. DEEP. Deep. deep," the cave answered.

A big dark pool of water lay in the middle of the floor. High up, purple crystals glowed in the dark. The pool looked like a mirror full of purple stars.

The leaf was on a wet rock in the center of the pool. One corner hung over the water.

They looked at the deep water. Then they looked at each other.

Liska held her breath. It looked very deep.


"We have to cross," she said.

"It goes down forever," Anji breathed.

They leaned closer, and three small faces floated up from the black, upside down, staring back.

Anji made a tiny wave with his paw, and the “other Anji” waved back.

Liska tested the edge with one toe, then put her whole paw down... The water was only as deep as her ankle. 

"It's okay!" she said.

Anji splashed in. The ripples sent the stars spinning. "WOHOO!" 

The cavern answered: *wohoo... wohoo... wohoo...*

Tahrra waded in last. She stopped in the middle and tilted her head. Then she hummed — one low note. The crystals repeated it. She hummed higher. They repeated that too, a clear, happy sound. Her ears rotated. She hummed a third note and her golden eyes went wide. "They sing back," she whispered.


They crossed together, holding paws. The water came up to their ankles and their tails dipped in — three furry brushstrokes painting light across the pool. Anji kept looking back at the trail they were leaving. "We're GLOWING," he whispered.

Liska's wet paws sparkled as she reached down and scooped up the leaf.

They splashed back across the pool, climbed up through the winding tunnel, and up ahead the entrance appeared, a slice of bright sky.

The lynx cub was right where they'd left him, sitting on a rock, chin on his knees. He saw them coming out of the dark — his ears shot up so fast they practically left his head.

Liska held out the leaf. "Got it."

He took it in both paws and pressed it to his chest. "Was it scary in there?"

The three friends looked at each other. Liska's fur was still damp. Anji's eyes were huge. Tahrra had her notebook out, already drawing.

"There's a pool," Liska started.

"It looks BOTTOMLESS," Anji cut in, "but it's NOT, it's THIS deep —" He held his paws apart. "And there are STARS —"

"Crystals," Tahrra corrected, not looking up.

"CRYSTAL STARS, and when you walk through the water —" Anji kept telling the story.

The lynx cub pressed his leaf into the crack with both paws until it held. He smiled. His wish was safe. And the three friends had a great story to tell.
