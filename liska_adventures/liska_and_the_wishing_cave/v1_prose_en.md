# The Crystal Cave

The wind at the cave mouth made the crystals sing.

Not real singing -- more like a long, low hum that changed when you moved your head. Liska tilted her ears left, then right, then left again, conducting the wall like an orchestra.

"This one's mine," Anji announced, holding up a leaf the size of his face. He'd drawn something on it in charcoal -- possibly a fish, possibly a boat, possibly an explosion. "It's a wish for the biggest adventure EVER."

"You drew that upside down," Tahrra said.

"That makes it MORE powerful."

Anji shoved his leaf into a crack in the rock with so much force that three other wishes popped out the back. He stuffed them in again, patting the stone like he was putting it to bed.

Children came to the Crystal Cave entrance to tuck wishes into the rock. Everyone in Sunstone City knew that. You drew your hope on a leaf, folded it tight, and wedged it into one of the thousand little crevices that lined the cave mouth. The wind would hum through the crystals and carry your wish somewhere deep inside the mountain.

Liska placed hers carefully -- a small leaf with a drawing of her family, their tails all tangled together. She pressed it in with one finger and held her paw there for a moment.

Behind them, a small lynx cub stood on his toes, reaching for a crack just above his head. His leaf was folded so many times it was barely bigger than a pebble. He stretched, stretched -- and a gust of cave-breath snatched it from his fingers.

The leaf tumbled into the dark.

The lynx cub's ears flattened. His chin trembled. He stared into the cave like he'd just watched something fall off a cliff.

"I'll get it," Liska said.

"We'll ALL get it," Anji corrected, already two steps into the cave.

Tahrra looked at the lynx cub, then at the dark, then followed without a word.

The humming got deeper as they went in. The daylight behind them shrank to a bright coin, then a bright button, then a bright crumb. But it wasn't truly dark -- veins of crystal threaded the walls, catching some light from somewhere and holding it, so the stone around them glowed a faint, cold blue.

"There!" Anji pointed. The leaf had landed on a ledge, just ahead.

Liska reached for it. Another gust rolled through the tunnel and the leaf skittered away, deeper into the passage.

"Oh, come ON," she groaned.

They chased it around a bend, down a slope, past walls where the crystals grew thick as fur. The humming faded. The air went still and cool and smelled like wet stone.

Anji's tail bumped Liska's shoulder. "We're pretty deep," he whispered. His whisper bounced off every surface and came back six times louder.

"There," Tahrra said quietly. She pointed down.

The tunnel opened into a cavern. And in the cavern was a pool.

It was perfectly still. Not a ripple, not a shimmer. The water was so clear it looked like nothing was there at all -- just a hole dropping straight down into blackness. Bioluminescent moss clung to the rocks beneath the surface, glowing soft green and pale gold, and the glow went down and down and down until it disappeared. It looked bottomless.

The leaf sat on the far side, resting against a crystal.

Liska's tail wrapped tight around her own ankle. Anji, for once, had nothing to say. They stood at the edge and stared.

"We have to cross," Liska said.

"It goes down forever," Anji breathed.

Tahrra crouched, reached one paw out, and touched the water. She pushed down. Her paw hit stone almost immediately.

"It doesn't," she said.

Liska stepped in. The water came up to her ankles -- cool, clear, and shallow as a puddle. The glowing moss was right there on the bottom, bright as lanterns, and the crystals beneath the surface caught the light and threw it everywhere. The whole cavern lit up.

"Oh," Liska said. Just that. Oh.

The pool was like a mirror. She could see herself looking back -- white fur, wide brown eyes, the blue-green glow turning her spots to something like starlight. The ceiling was covered in crystals that reflected the moss-light, and standing in the water was like standing inside a sky full of stars that went in every direction, up and down and all around.

Anji splashed in next, and the ripples sent the stars spinning. "WOHOO!" His voice rang off every surface and the cavern answered back: wohoo... wohoo... wohoo..

Tahrra waded in last, golden eyes wide, and for several seconds she just turned in a slow circle, looking.

They crossed the pool together, water swirling around their ankles, leaving trails of scattered light behind every step. Liska scooped up the leaf and held it over her head like a trophy.

---

The lynx cub was right where they'd left him, sitting on a rock with his chin on his knees. When he saw them coming out of the dark, his ears shot up so fast they practically left his head.

Liska held out the leaf. "Got it."

He took it in both paws and pressed it to his chest. Then he looked up. "Was it scary in there?"

The three friends looked at each other. Liska's fur was still damp. Anji's eyes were the size of lanterns. Tahrra had her notebook out and was already drawing.

"There's a pool," Liska started.

"It looks BOTTOMLESS," Anji cut in, "but it's NOT, it's THIS deep --" He held his paws apart. "And there are STARS --"

"Crystals," Tahrra corrected, not looking up from her sketch.

"CRYSTAL STARS, and when you walk through the water --"

The lynx cub tucked his wish-leaf into the nearest crack, carefully, and sat back down to listen. His eyes were wide, and his ears were pointed forward, and his chin wasn't trembling at all anymore.

The cave hummed behind them, low and steady, like it was keeping a secret it was glad someone finally found.
