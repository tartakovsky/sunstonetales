# The Crystal Cave

Today, Liska, Anji and Tahrra went to the Crystal Cave.

Children in Sunstone City came here to make wishes. You drew your hope on a leaf, folded it tight, and wedged it into one of the cracks that lined the cave mouth. The wind hummed through the crystals and carried your wish deep inside the mountain.

Liska placed hers carefully — a small leaf with a drawing of her family, tails tangled together. She pressed it in with one finger and held her paw there for a moment.

A small lynx cub nearby stood on his toes, reaching for a crack above his head. His leaf was folded so many times it was barely bigger than a pebble. He stretched, stretched — and a gust of cave-breath snatched it from his fingers.

The leaf tumbled into the dark.

<!-- Lame, needs to be expressing his held in distress more vividly -->
His chin trembled.

<!--
OPTIONS — Lynx Cub's held-in distress:

1. He sucked in a breath and held it. His whole body went tight — fists squeezed shut, ears pressed flat, eyes scrunched into lines. He was holding everything in so hard he was shaking.

2. He made a sound like a hiccup swallowed sideways. His ears folded down one at a time, slowly, like two little flags lowering. He bit the inside of his cheek and blinked very fast at the ceiling.

3. His paws opened and closed at his sides — grabbing for something that wasn't there anymore. He pressed his lips together until they disappeared, and his breath came out in one long, wobbly whistle through his nose.

4. He stood completely still, the way you do when you know that if you move even a tiny bit, everything inside will spill out. His tail curled tight around his own ankle. One ear twitched.

5. His mouth did the thing — that awful sideways stretch where you're trying to make it smile but it won't listen. He looked at his empty paws like they'd betrayed him.
-->

"I'll get it," Liska said.

"We'll ALL get it," Anji corrected. Tahrra nodded.

Liska grabbed Anji's paw, Anji grabbed Tahrra's, and the three of them stepped into the dark together.

---

<!-- that's telling, not showing. Boring. -->
It wasn't truly dark inside — veins of crystal threaded the walls, glowing a faint cold blue. The daylight behind them shrank to a crumb.

<!--
OPTIONS — Entering the cave (showing, not telling):

1. The sunlight peeled off their fur one step at a time. First the warmth went. Then the colors — Tahrra's orange dress turned gray, Anji's cream fur turned silver. The air pressed in close and tasted like licking a stone. But the walls weren't black. Thin lines of crystal crawled through the rock, glowing a cold blue, like the cave had veins and they were walking inside something alive. Behind them, the entrance shrank to a bright crumb.

2. Cold found them first — not wind-cold but stone-cold, the kind that lives underground and has been waiting. Their pawsteps stopped slapping and started echoing. Liska's ears swiveled: every drip, every scuffle came back doubled. Then she noticed the walls. Crystals, thin as spider-thread, ran through the rock in tangled lines, each one lit from inside with a blue glow so faint it was almost a secret. She turned around. The cave mouth was already the size of her paw.

3. Three steps in and Liska couldn't feel the sun anymore. Five steps and the outside sounds — birds, wind, other children's voices — just stopped, like someone had closed a lid. The silence had weight. It sat on her ears. Her own breathing sounded enormous. Then her eyes caught up with the dark: the walls were threaded with crystal, thin glowing blue lines cracking through the stone like frost on a window. Not bright. But enough.

4. Everything changed at once. The ground went from dirt to smooth stone under their paws. The air went cool and damp and still — so still that Liska could feel each breath land on her whiskers and stay there. The light didn't disappear; it traded. Warm gold behind them, shrinking. Cold blue ahead, growing. Crystals in the walls, thin as scratches, giving off their own pale glow — enough to see shapes, not enough to see colors.

5. Anji's fur prickled. "It's cold." Not wind-cold. Bone-cold. The kind that comes up through the floor. Their shadows stretched out long behind them toward the cave mouth, and then the cave mouth got smaller, and smaller, and then the shadows had nowhere to come from and just — went away. But the dark wasn't total. The walls glittered. Thin crystal veins, glowing pale blue, stitched through the rock like someone had sewn the cave together with frozen light.
-->

"There!" Anji pointed. The leaf sat on a ledge just ahead.

Liska reached for it. Another gust rolled through the tunnel and the leaf skittered deeper into the passage.

They chased it around a bend, down a slope, past walls where the crystals grew thick as fur. The humming faded. The air went still and cool and smelled like wet stone.

Anji's tail bumped Liska's shoulder. "We're pretty deep," he whispered. *DEEP, DEEP, DE-E-EEP*, answered the cave.

<!-- their emotional reaction here -->


<!-- Boring, no foreshadowing -->
The tunnel opened into a cavern. And in the cavern was a pool.

<!--
OPTIONS — Sensing the pool before seeing it (foreshadowing, building anticipation):

1. The tunnel widened. The air changed — wetter, heavier, the kind of air that's been sitting above water in the dark for a long, long time. Their pawsteps, which had been sharp little clicks, suddenly softened and spread, as if the space around them had opened up like a held breath letting go. Then Liska looked down. The floor ended. And below it — a pool.

2. Something shifted. The echo of their steps changed — it used to come back fast and tight, wall-wall-wall, and now it went out and didn't come back. The air was different too. Cooler. Wetter. It tasted green. Liska felt the space before she saw it — the ceiling pulling away, the walls falling back. The ground sloped down, and there, at the bottom of everything: a pool.

3. The humming had stopped. So had every other sound. The silence in front of them was bigger than the silence behind — wider, deeper, like the cave had been holding a room behind its back. Liska's whiskers twitched. Damp air. A smell like rain on stone. They rounded the last bend and the tunnel let go of them, and there, in the middle of a cavern so still it felt like the inside of a held breath — a pool.

4. Tahrra stopped. She pressed one paw flat to the wall and kept it there. "It's wet," she said. The stone under their feet was slick now. The air had changed, too — thick and cool, the kind you breathe in a bathroom after someone's had a long bath. The tunnel opened. The ceiling disappeared upward into dark. And the reason for all of it was right there in front of them: a pool, sitting in the cavern floor like an eye looking up.

5. Anji's ears rotated forward. "Do you hear that?" They stopped. Not silence — something under silence. A hush that had weight. The air on Liska's tongue tasted different: clean and cold and old, the way a puddle smells in winter. The walls pulled back. The ceiling climbed. And the tunnel poured them out onto the edge of a cavern with a pool at its center, perfectly round, perfectly still.
-->

Perfectly still. The water was so clear it looked like nothing was there — just a hole dropping into blackness. [Bioluminescent moss glowed beneath the surface], green and pale gold, going down and down and down. It looked bottomless.

<!-- [Bioluminescent moss glowed beneath the surface] - does it even work like that? -->

<!--
OPTIONS — The source of the glow (physically plausible):

1. Crystals lined the bottom and walls of the pool, the same blue-white as the tunnel but thicker here, brighter. Their light passed up through the clear water and made the whole pool glow, green and pale gold where it hit patches of moss clinging to the rocks, going down and down and down. It looked bottomless.

2. Moss grew in thick patches on the rocks around the pool's edge, glowing green and pale gold. The crystals in the cavern walls caught that light and threw it down into the water, so the pool itself seemed to glow from the inside, going down and down and down. It looked bottomless.

3. The cavern ceiling was crusted with crystals, and their cold light fell straight down into the pool like a shaft. The water was so clear it carried the glow all the way to the bottom — or where the bottom should have been. Moss on the underwater stones caught the light and held it, green and pale gold, going down and down and down. It looked bottomless.

4. The rock around the pool was covered in moss — the kind that glows, soft green and pale gold. It crept right to the water's edge and the light it gave off sank into the clear water, mixing with the crystal-glow from the walls, so the pool looked lit from every direction at once, going down and down and down. It looked bottomless.

5. The crystals here were huge — thick clusters growing out of the walls and ceiling, blazing cold blue. Their light hit the water and kept going, straight down through the clear surface, catching on stone and moss below until the whole pool shimmered, green and pale gold, going down and down and down. It looked bottomless.
-->

The leaf sat on the far side, [resting against a crystal.]

<!-- Boring, no tension -->
Nobody moved.

"We have to cross," Liska said.

"It goes down forever," Anji breathed.

<!--
OPTIONS — Tension, wonder, vertigo, the MIRROR moment (before anyone enters):

1. They stood at the edge and looked down. The water was so still that Liska could see herself in it — every whisker, every spot, perfect and upside-down, hanging over the glowing deep. Three reflections stared back at them from the surface: a snow leopard, a cat, a panther, floating above what looked like a sky full of stars that went down forever. Nobody breathed. It was like standing on the edge of a cliff that went both ways.

2. None of them stepped forward. Liska looked down, and the pool looked back. The surface was so flat, so perfectly still, that it held their faces — three kids, side by side, reflected as sharply as in a mirror. Below the reflections, the crystal-light went down into darkness. It was like looking through a window in the floor of the world. Liska's stomach did a slow roll. If you fell, you'd fall forever.

3. Liska's toes curled over the edge. She looked down and her own face looked up — round eyes, silver spots, ears pricked forward — painted on the water so perfectly she could count her whiskers. Anji and Tahrra floated beside her, three upside-down children hanging over a bottomless glowing dark. "Don't move," Anji whispered, but he wasn't talking to anyone. He was talking to himself. The pool was so still that moving felt like it would break the world.

4. The water was glass. Three faces hung in it, clear and sharp — Liska saw her own wide brown eyes, Anji's flattened ears, Tahrra's golden stare, all of them reflected on the surface of something that looked like it had no bottom at all. She had the dizzy, lurching feeling of looking over a rooftop. Her tail wrapped around her own leg without being told to. Below their reflections, the glow went down into nothing. "That's us," Anji said, very quietly. The cave did not repeat it.

5. They looked down and the pool looked up. The surface was a mirror — Liska could see herself so clearly she almost waved. Three children crouched at the edge of a glowing abyss that held their reflections like portraits. Tahrra's golden eyes met her own golden eyes in the water. Liska's tail swayed, and the tail in the reflection swayed with it, hanging over all that crystal-lit dark. Her knees felt strange. Not scared-strange. Big-strange. Like standing somewhere you're not supposed to be able to stand.
-->

<!-- Boring, no tension. Where is the wonder of them looking into the mirror? -->
Tahrra crouched, reached one paw out, and touched the water. Pushed down. Hit stone almost immediately.

"It doesn't," she said.

<!--
OPTIONS — Tahrra testing the water, wonder before the practical moment:

1. Tahrra didn't say anything. She crouched and stared at her own face in the pool, nose almost touching nose, gold eyes almost touching gold eyes. Then, slowly — the way you touch something you're not sure is real — she reached one paw down. Her claw-tip touched the surface. The mirror shattered. Her reflection broke into rings. She pushed down. Hit stone almost immediately. "It doesn't," she said. Go down forever.

2. Tahrra lay flat on her belly and hung her head over the edge. Her reflection hung below her, upside-down, golden eyes wide. For a long moment she just looked at it, the way she looked at things she was about to draw. Then she stretched one paw out and pressed down through her own face. Ripples. Stone under her paw-pads, close and solid. "It doesn't," she said. Her reflection, broken into wobbly pieces, slowly put itself back together.

3. Tahrra crouched at the edge and held her paw out, hovering just above the surface. She tilted her head. In the pool, an upside-down panther tilted its head the other way. She wiggled her fingers. It wiggled back. Then she pushed through. Her paw punched a hole in her own face. The glow scattered. Stone met her paw-pad, hard and close. "It doesn't," she said. Go down forever. She pulled her paw back and watched the water go flat again, watched her face come back, dripping.

4. They all stared at the mirror. Tahrra stared longest. She reached down — not fast, not slow, the way you turn a page you don't want to tear — and one claw broke the surface. Just barely. A single ring spread out and swallowed all three reflections. Then she pressed her whole paw in. Stone, right there. "It doesn't," she said.

5. Tahrra knelt. Her reflection knelt with her. Gold eyes met gold eyes across the thinnest line in the world — the place where water stopped and air started. She studied it the way she studied everything: like she was memorizing it. Then she reached down, very carefully, and put her paw through the surface. Her reflection vanished in ripples. Her paw hit bottom before her wrist got wet. "It doesn't," she said.
-->

---

Liska stepped in. Ankle-deep — cool, clear, shallow as a puddle. The glowing moss was right there on the bottom, and the crystals beneath the surface caught the light and threw it everywhere. The whole cavern lit up.

<!-- It's not a fucking mirror when you're already in it making waves -->
[The pool was a mirror. She could see herself looking back.] The ceiling was covered in crystals reflecting the moss-light, and standing in the water was like standing inside a sky full of stars going in every direction.

<!--
OPTIONS — Replace the mirror line. What it ACTUALLY looks like stepping into glowing water:

1. Her paw broke the surface and the light broke with it. Ripples ran out from her ankle and the crystals in the water caught each wave and turned it into a moving ring of glow — green, gold, blue — spreading across the pool like someone had dropped a star. The ceiling caught it all and threw it back. Suddenly she was standing inside light. It moved with her. Every step sent new rings pulsing outward, and the whole cavern breathed with color.

2. The second her foot hit the water, the stillness shattered into light. Ripples rolled out from her paw and wherever they touched the crystals on the bottom, the glow jumped — flared — scattered up the walls in shivering lines. The cavern ceiling caught it and blazed. It was like stepping into a puddle and accidentally turning on the sky. Liska looked down at her own paws, glowing green-gold beneath the surface, and laughed.

3. She took a step and the pool woke up. Rings of light spiraled out from her ankle, hitting the crystals, bouncing between the walls. Her fur lit up from below — green, then gold, then something in between. The whole cavern rippled with her. Above, the crystal ceiling caught every wave and turned it into moving constellations. She stood in the center of it, dripping light.

4. One step, and the water remembered it could move. A ripple rolled out from her paw and the crystals grabbed it, lit it up, flung the glow sideways and upward until every wall was swimming with reflected light. The ceiling flashed. The floor flashed. Liska held her paws out and they were striped with moving color — green-gold waves sliding across her white fur, across everything. It wasn't a sky full of stars. It was a sky full of stars that were alive.

5. The water had been holding its breath. Liska's paw broke it open. Light erupted — not bright, not sudden, but rolling outward from her step in a slow wave of green and gold that climbed the crystals, climbed the walls, hit the ceiling and rained back down as a thousand tiny shifting reflections. She looked up and the cave looked back, covered in moving light, and she felt like she was standing at the bottom of something beautiful that went up forever.
-->

The ceiling was covered in crystals reflecting the moss-light, and standing in the water was like standing inside a sky full of stars going in every direction.

Anji splashed in. The ripples sent the stars spinning. "WOHOO!" The cavern answered: *wohoo... wohoo... wohoo...*

<!-- boring. her autistic exploration needs to be INTERESTING -->
Tahrra waded in last. She crouched low, studying the moss up close, then stood and turned in a slow circle, golden eyes wide, looking at everything.

<!--
OPTIONS — Tahrra's way of experiencing the pool (specific, detail-obsessed, art-brain):

1. Tahrra waded in last. She didn't splash. She didn't shout. She held her paw under the water and tilted it, watching the light slide across her dark fur in slow ribbons. Then she crouched, pressed her nose almost to the surface, and blew — one tiny breath. The ripple it made turned into a ring of light that hit the far wall. She did it again. And again. Each breath made a different ring. She was composing something.

2. Tahrra waded in last. She went straight down to her knees, put her face close to the water, and stayed there. "What are you doing?" Anji asked. "Counting colors," Tahrra said. She held one finger up: wait. After a long pause, she said, "Seven." Then she pulled out her notebook — held it high above the water with one paw — and drew something with the other paw, tracing the shape of a crystal pattern on the surface with her claw-tip, memorizing it.

3. Tahrra waded in last and stood very still. Then she lifted one foot. Set it down somewhere else. Watched the light change. Lifted the other foot. Set it down. Watched again. She was testing. Every spot in the pool made a different pattern — different crystals underneath, different colors bouncing up. She found the spot she wanted and stopped. Pulled out her notebook. Drew.

4. Tahrra waded in last. She cupped water in both paws, lifted it up to her eyes, and looked through it at the ceiling. The crystals above, seen through the water, split into twice as many colors. She tilted her paws and the colors slid sideways. She tilted them back. Her mouth was open, just slightly. She poured the water back — watched the splash send light scattering — then immediately scooped up more and looked through it again, from a different angle.

5. Tahrra waded in last. She picked up a pebble from the bottom, held it up to the crystal-light, and turned it over. Put it back in a slightly different spot. Picked up another one. She was rearranging the pool floor, pebble by pebble, as if she could change the way the light worked. And somehow, in the little patch around her feet, she could. The glow shifted, concentrated, and for a moment her own paws lit up gold from below, and she held them out and stared at them like they belonged to someone else.
-->

<!-- Boring. Tails dragging on water or some other vivid imagery -->
They crossed together, water swirling around their ankles, trails of scattered light behind every step. Liska scooped up the leaf.

<!--
OPTIONS — Crossing the pool together, vivid physical imagery:

1. They crossed together. Every paw left a glowing footprint on the bottom that faded slowly, so the pool behind them was full of fading paw-tracks made of light. Their tails dragged through the water and each one pulled a trail of scattered glow — white-green behind Liska, pale gold behind Anji, deep blue behind Tahrra. Liska scooped up the leaf.

2. They crossed together, three sets of paws stirring up the light from the bottom like kicked-up dust, except this dust glowed. Liska's tail swept the surface and left a wide streak of rippling green behind her. Anji's tail whipped side to side and turned his half of the pool into a light-storm. Tahrra's barely touched the water — just the tip — drawing one clean, thin line of gold. Liska scooped up the leaf.

3. They crossed together. The water was alive around their ankles — every step sent light spiraling out in rings, and where their rings collided, the glow flared brighter, so the path they walked became the brightest part of the pool. Their tails left wakes. Three wavering lines of light trailed behind them, tangling together, crossing and re-crossing like loose threads. Liska scooped up the leaf.

4. They crossed together, and the pool lit up their path. Liska's paws pushed through the glow like walking through paint — each step left a green-gold bloom that slowly closed behind her. Anji kicked up tiny clouds of light with every step, too excited to walk straight. Their tails trailed in the water: three dark brushstrokes pulling color behind them across a glowing canvas. Liska scooped up the leaf.

5. They crossed together, single file, and the pool recorded every step — bright spots where their paws pressed down, slow-fading rings where they lifted up, and three long shimmering trails where their tails dragged through the water behind them, painting the surface with light. The cavern pulsed gently with their crossing, walls flickering, ceiling shifting, as if the whole cave was breathing with them. Liska scooped up the leaf.
-->

<!-- Too disconnected, one sentence about them going back? -->
---

<!--
OPTIONS — Transition sentence before the break:

1. They waded back across the pool, faster now, the glow chasing their heels, and climbed out into the tunnel carrying the leaf and the cave-smell in their fur.

2. The way back felt shorter. The pool's glow faded behind them, the crystal-veins in the tunnel thinned, and then there was sunlight — sharp and warm and almost too bright.

3. They carried the leaf back through the tunnel, dripping, their wet paw-prints glowing faintly on the stone behind them for a few steps before going dark.

4. The tunnel swallowed the pool's light behind them. By the time they reached the cave mouth, the daylight hit their eyes like a shout.

5. They walked out the way they'd walked in — together — blinking against the sunlight, fur damp, smelling like wet stone and something that glowed.
-->

The lynx cub was right where they'd left him, sitting on a rock, chin on his knees. He saw them coming out of the dark — his ears shot up so fast they practically left his head.

Liska held out the leaf. "Got it."

He took it in both paws and pressed it to his chest. "Was it scary in there?"

The three friends looked at each other. Liska's fur was still damp. Anji's eyes were huge. Tahrra had her notebook out, already drawing.

"There's a pool," Liska started.

"It looks BOTTOMLESS," Anji cut in, "but it's NOT, it's THIS deep —" He held his paws apart. "And there are STARS —"

"Crystals," Tahrra corrected, not looking up.

"CRYSTAL STARS, and when you walk through the water —"

<!-- Boring ending -->
The lynx cub tucked his wish-leaf into the nearest crack, carefully, and sat down to listen.

<!--
OPTIONS — The ending (final resonant beat):

1. The lynx cub tucked his wish-leaf into the nearest crack, carefully, with both paws this time. Then he sat down right between Anji and Liska, leaned forward, and said, "Tell me everything." And they did.

2. The lynx cub tucked his wish-leaf into the nearest crack — not too high this time, just right — and pressed it in with one finger, the way Liska had done with hers. Then he sat down to listen. Anji was still talking. Anji would be talking for a very long time.

3. The lynx cub tucked his wish-leaf into the nearest crack, carefully. Then he looked at the cave mouth — at the dark that had swallowed his leaf and given it back — and his ears didn't fold down this time. "Can I see it?" he asked. Liska looked at Anji. Anji looked at Tahrra. Tahrra closed her notebook. "Come on," Liska said.

4. The lynx cub tucked his wish-leaf into the nearest crack, carefully, and sat down to listen. The wind hummed through the cracks and carried the wishing-leaves deeper into the mountain, past the tunnel, past the crystal walls, all the way down to the pool where three sets of glowing pawprints were still fading, slowly, on the bottom.

5. The lynx cub tucked his wish-leaf into the nearest crack, carefully, and sat down to listen. He didn't need to make a new wish. The leaf was back. Three kids he'd never met had gone into the dark to get it. That was better than wishing.
-->



----

Moss clung to the crystal walls above the pool, casting green and pale-gold light downward. The water caught every flicker and carried it deep, deeper, down and down and down. It looked bottomless.
