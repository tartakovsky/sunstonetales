# 3. The Crystal Cave

## Core Idea

Liska, Anji, and Tahrra are at the Crystal Cave entrance where kids tuck wish-leaves into rock cracks. Lynx Cub is there too — his wish-leaf blows into the cave. Liska decides to go get it back, and the chase pulls the three friends deeper than anyone's been.

## Beat-by-beat Structure

**Beat 1 — Arrival and wishes (~80 words)**
Open with: "Today, Liska, Anji and Tahrra..."
They arrive at the Crystal Cave. Brief, punchy intro of the wish-leaf tradition — kids draw hopes on leaves, fold them, wedge them into cracks in the cave mouth. The wind hums through the crystals and carries wishes deeper inside. Keep this SHORT — 2-3 sentences max for the tradition, then into action.

Liska places hers carefully — a small leaf with a drawing of her family, tails tangled together. She presses it in with one finger and holds her paw there.

**Beat 2 — Lynx Cub's leaf blows in (~40 words)**
A small lynx cub nearby, on his toes, reaching for a crack above his head. His leaf is folded so many times it's barely bigger than a pebble. He stretches — a gust of cave-breath snatches it from his fingers. The leaf tumbles into the dark. His chin trembles.

"I'll get it," Liska says.

**Beat 3 — The chase deeper (~80 words)**
They go in. The leaf is ahead — they almost grab it — another gust takes it further in. Just ONE failed grab, not a repeating gag. Then the chase pulls them around a bend, down a slope, past walls where crystals grow thick as fur. The humming fades. The air goes still and cool and smells like wet stone.

Anji's tail bumps Liska's shoulder. "We're pretty deep," he whispers. (His whisper echoes.)

**Beat 4 — The pool (~100 words)**
The tunnel opens into a cavern. The pool. Perfectly still, crystal-clear — so clear it looks like nothing is there, just a hole dropping into blackness. Bioluminescent moss glows beneath the surface, going down and down. Looks bottomless.

The leaf is on the far side, resting against a crystal.

They stare. Nobody moves. "We have to cross," Liska says. Anji: "It goes down forever."

Tahrra crouches, reaches one paw, touches the water. Pushes down. Hits stone almost immediately. "It doesn't."

**Beat 5 — Wonder (~120 words)**
Liska steps in. Ankle-deep — cool, clear, shallow as a puddle. The glowing moss is right there on the bottom. The crystals beneath the surface catch the light and throw it everywhere. The whole cavern lights up.

The pool is a mirror — she sees herself looking back. The ceiling is covered in crystals reflecting the moss-light. Standing in the water is like standing inside a sky full of stars going in every direction. (Keep this imagery but SHORTER than draft v1.)

Anji splashes in. The ripples send the stars spinning. "WOHOO!" The cavern answers: wohoo... wohoo... wohoo...

Tahrra wades in last — she does something quiet, deliberate, very HER with the water. Draws a slow circle with her paw, or crouches to study the moss up close, or just turns in a slow circle looking.

They cross together.

**Beat 6 — Return and telling (~120 words)**
The lynx cub is right where they left him, sitting on a rock, chin on his knees. Sees them coming out of the dark — ears shoot up so fast they practically leave his head.

Liska holds out the leaf. "Got it."

He takes it in both paws, presses it to his chest. "Was it scary in there?"

The three friends look at each other. Liska's fur is still damp. Anji's eyes are huge. Tahrra has her notebook out, already drawing.

"There's a pool," Liska starts.
"It looks BOTTOMLESS," Anji cuts in, "but it's NOT, it's THIS deep—" holds paws apart. "And there are STARS—"
"Crystals," Tahrra corrects, not looking up.
"CRYSTAL STARS, and when you walk through the water—"

Lynx Cub tucks his wish-leaf into the nearest crack, carefully, and sits down to listen.

## Key Rules
- Start with "Today, Liska, Anji and Tahrra..."
- The wish tradition intro must be SHORT — 2-3 sentences max
- Anji does NOT show his wish before arriving at the cave
- ONE failed leaf-grab, not a repeating gag
- Tahrra tests the water (she's the one who figures out it's shallow)
- The wonder imagery is vivid but concise — don't overwrite
- The ending with all three talking over each other telling Lynx Cub is the payoff
- ~700 words total
