# 1. Liska and Her Name

## Core Idea

Liska asks why she's called Liska (literally "little fox"). Mara tells her a bedtime story about a real white fox cub the family cared for back in Sar-Gora, before Liska was born. The adventure is the fox's journey — told from the fox's perspective.

## What We've Figured Out

**Structure:** Frame → fox adventure → back to frame.
- ~100 words: something triggers the name question, bedtime, Mara starts telling
- ~600 words: the fox's adventure
- Back to bedroom. Liska understands her name. Mara says something small.

**The fox's POV is the hook.** We never name human things. The fox sees a tall stone thing breathing white clouds (chimney), a flat shiny surface with warm light trapped behind it (window), enormous soft-footed creatures (the family). The child listening pieces it together — that's the engagement. It's a puzzle wrapped in a story.

**Vibe: cozy-tense, not survival.** The fox is small, the world is big, everything is unfamiliar. Snowdrifts up to its chest, a branch dumping snow on its head, strange smells and lights. The tension is "will this tiny fox be brave enough?" — not "will it survive?" No predators, no real danger. Just the bigness of everything and the fox's smallness.

**Approach-retreat as suspense.** The fox wants to reach the warm light but keeps getting spooked by small things — a door closing, a shadow moving. Not scary, just unfamiliar. The child listener is willing the fox forward.

**Trust moment as climax.** The fox steps inside / takes the food / lets a hand touch it. Peak of the story — a moment of courage from something tiny.

**Three beats inside the fox's journey:** discover the warm light → approach-retreat → trust.

**The frame cuts.** Drop into the fox's POV once Mara starts telling. Maybe one tiny cut back to the bedroom ("Liska pulled the blanket closer") to remind you it's a bedtime story. Then back into the snow.

**The fox's reason:** It's winter in Sar-Gora. Cold, snowy, windy — edge of the city, not wilderness. The fox cub is cold and sees a warm strange glowing place. Wants shelter and is curious. Simple real motivations — cold + wonder, not survival-danger.

**Trigger / Opening scene:** We skip the market entirely. Start at bedtime. Liska comes to Mara indignant/incredulous — she heard someone at the market use the word "liski" referring to foxes, but she doesn't know the animal (foxes don't exist in Sunstone City, she left Sar-Gora at ~1). She thinks there are multiple *her*. She delivers a specific funny line — child-logic outrage, like "Mama, a man said liski got into his kitchen! I have NEVER been in his kitchen!" Mara laughs, tucks her in, and tells the story. Zero words spent on the market scene. All the humor is in Liska's confused, indignant delivery.

## Source Material
- `liska_struggles/14_night_of_twinkling_lights/` — the fox name-story lives here, told by Mara during the festival as an identity anchor
- `liska_struggles/7_liska_tuft/` — the fox backstory woven in here too, parallel between fox exploring and Liska's first independence
- `prompts/setting.md` — Sar-Gora (Northern/Siberian vibe) is where the fox story takes place

## Open Questions
- Who does the fox encounter at the house — young Mara? Daric? Both?
- How does Mara's closing line land without being preachy?
- Liska's exact funny line — needs to land perfectly
- The trust moment specifics — what does the fox do, what does the person do?
