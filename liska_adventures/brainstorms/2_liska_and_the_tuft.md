# 2. Liska and the Tuft

## Core Idea

Liska discovers a tuft of her own baby fur — a small piece saved by Mara from when Liska was born. This leads to a story about when Liska was tiny and the white fox (her namesake) was still living with the family.

**This is a separate story from "Liska and Her Name."** The name story is about the fox's arrival. The tuft story is about Liska-as-baby and the fox together — a different moment in the family's history.

## Source Material (needs synthesis)

The tuft concept and the fox-and-baby-Liska connection are scattered across multiple files. A future session should read these and figure out what's usable:

- `liska_struggles/7_liska_tuft/` — **primary source.** The tuft is central here: a piece of baby fur on a string, saved by Mara. Used as a comfort object during first overnight separation. The fox backstory is woven in as a parallel to Liska's bravery. Read all files in this directory.
- `liska_struggles/14_night_of_twinkling_lights/` — the fox story is told here by Mara as an identity anchor during sensory overwhelm. May have details about the fox's time with the family.
- `liska_struggles/12_liska_first_mark/` — might have related identity/baby-Liska material. Worth checking.

## What We Know So Far
- The tuft is a piece of Liska's baby fur, tied on a string
- Mara saved it from the day Liska was born — "the happiest day of my life"
- The fox was still with the family when Liska was a baby (overlap period)
- The emotional territory is different from the name story — this is about the bond between mother and child, the preciousness of babyhood, maybe the fox and baby Liska interacting

## Open Questions
- What's the adventure here? Finding the tuft is the trigger, but what's the story?
- Is it another bedtime story (Mara telling about baby Liska and the fox)?
- Or is it more present-day — Liska finding the tuft leads to something?
- What's the emotional thread that makes this edge-of-the-seat?
- How does it relate to but stay distinct from the name story?
