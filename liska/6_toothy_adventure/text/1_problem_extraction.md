## Goal

We are teaching the reader that it's okay to be scared and providing a concrete strategy to manage fear. The story addresses the common childhood problem of being terrified of necessary experiences, like visiting the dentist. We offer a solution through Liska, a relatable character who learns to use a "courage object" and a refrain ("I'm scared, but I'm trying") to face her fear. This approach empowers the child by validating their feelings and giving them practical tools, rather than dismissing their fear or moralizing about bravery. It reframes courage as the act of trying despite being afraid.

## Synopsis

After cracking her tooth while playing, Liska is overcome with fear at the thought of visiting the dentist. She tries to hide the injury, but the pain eventually makes it clear that it is better to tell her parents. They validate her fear, reframing it as a normal feeling of being a "little mouse" that wants to hide, and introduce a coping strategy: a special "courage stone" to hold and a refrain to repeat, "I'm scared, but I'm trying."

At the dentist's office, Liska's resolve is tested when she meets another child who is even more frightened. Motivated to help him, she uses her new tools to be brave, discovering that the visit isn't as scary as she imagined. She realizes that true courage isn't the absence of fear but acting despite it, and feels strongest when she helps others. She passes on the lesson by giving the other child her new comfort toy, demonstrating that she has internalized the skill.

## Detailed Q&A

**1. Who are the main characters in the story?**  
**A:** Liska (protagonist), Mother and Father (supporting characters), Tahrra (minor character), and a little lynx (supporting character).

---

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** Liska's overwhelming fear of the dentist, which paralyzes her and prevents her from getting necessary medical care.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** The fear causes Liska to withdraw and hide her pain from her family. It requires significant co-regulation from her parents. At the clinic, her fear is mirrored by another child, creating a social dynamic where she must choose between succumbing to her fear or overcoming it to help another.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** Liska learns to manage her fear by using a concrete coping strategy (a transitional object and a refrain) and discovering an internal source of courage through altruism.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** The story teaches two skills: using a physical coping mechanism (a "courage stone") paired with a cognitive refrain ("I'm scared, but I'm trying!"), and discovering that prosocial behavior (helping someone else) is a powerful tool for building one's own courage.

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  

**A:** Pain/Shock -> Fear (Freeze/Flight).

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** Fear is the central emotion. The entire plot revolves around Liska acknowledging, facing, and learning to manage her fear.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** Fear.
**Comments:** The story presents a common childhood fear of a medical procedure. Developmentally, it's crucial to teach children that fear is a normal and valid emotion, not something to be ashamed of. Providing concrete, actionable strategies to manage this fear (rather than dismiss it) empowers the child and builds resilience. The story effectively models this by having the parents validate the fear ("I understand you're scared") before offering a tool. This approach is more significant than focusing on the initial pain or subsequent relief, as the core developmental lesson is about building courage in the face of fear.

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** The story uses two primary metaphors for fear: the **Icicle (Сосулька)**, representing the paralyzing "freeze" response, and the **Little Mouse (Мышонок)**, representing the desire to hide and feel small, which the parents explicitly name and help Liska address.

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** "My Special Comfort Item" (the courage stone) and "Simple Self-Talk" (the "I'm scared, but I'm trying!" refrain).
