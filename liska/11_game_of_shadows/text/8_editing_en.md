One morning, Mama and Liska squeezed something HUGE through the bedroom door. 

"Just... a... little... more!" Mama grunted, pushing the heavy pot.

Liska planted her feet, grabbed a giant leaf, and tugged with a mighty little "IEEEH!".

With a final push, in came their new monstera plant, its leaves full of holes, just like Swiss cheese.

Liska poked her tiny pink nose through a leaf-hole.

"A cheese plant!" she said. "I name you Mr. Cheesy!"

That afternoon, Liska played with Mr. Cheesy's shadow. 

"High-five!" she giggled, slapping her palm against a leaf-shadow on the wall. 

The wind moved the plant's leaves, and the shadow moved away. A happy *SQUEEEE* burst from Liska as she chased it for another high-five.

As night fell, Mama tucked Liska in tight as a cinnamon roll, stuffed sloth, Slothy, snuggled under Liska's arm. Then, a *WHOOSH* of wind made Mr. Cheesy's shadow stretch and swing.

Suddenly, the leaf-shadows grew longer... and sharper... until they didn't look like leaves anymore. Now they looked like claws!

Liska's eyes widened. *It's just Mr. Cheesy.* She hugged Slothy and pulled the blanket over her head. "Go away," she whispered. "You're just a plant."

But under the blanket, her head filled with scary thoughts: What if the shadow crept closer? What if it touched her? What if— 

A quick, loud thumping started in her chest: BA-DUM, BA-DUM. BA-DUM, BA-DUM.

She threw off the blanket, tumbled out of bed, and scampered out of the room. 

"MAMA!" she cried. "The shadow has CLAWS and it wants to GRAB ME!"

Mama scooped her up.

"Oh, sweet kitten, you're so scared," she said softly.

She carried her back to the bedroom, and they peeked inside.

"You're right," Mama said. "That shadow does look a little spiky."

Liska nodded, leaving tears and maybe a little snot on Mama's nightgown. 

As Mama tucked Liska back into bed, she held up her paws in the moonlight, folding them until their shadow became a butterfly on the wall.

She made it fly closer to the plant. Then around its claw-shaped shadow. 

Liska watched, her eyes wide. The shadow butterfly was... beautiful? Not scary? 

"It's like they're playing," she whispered. 

The next evening, Liska asked, "Maamaa, I'm scared of that shadow. Help me?"

"Of course, kitten. How does your body feel?"

"My heart is going thump-thump, thump-thump," Liska said.

"Then let's help it calm down. Breathe in like you smell a flower, and breathe out like you cool down hot soup." Liska did a slow *SNIFF* in... and a long *WHOOOSH* out.

"Mama," she said. "remember the butterfly you made? I wanna make one, too."

Mama helped her link her thumbs together, and a wobbly butterfly appeared on the wall.

Then Mama lit the candle.

"Look, your watering can's shadow looks like an elephant. I bet its trunk is ticklish! Wanna tickle it?"

Liska made her butterfly circle the elephant once... twice... and... bopped it right on the tip of its trunk!

In the flickering candlelight, the trunk-shadow shook with what looked like giggles. A tiny *SNORT* came out of Liska. The trunk, it seemed, wanted to play.

Suddenly, a new thought sparked inside her: *Ooh! I can PLAY with them!*

Later that night, Mr. Cheesy's shadow again stretched across the wall. Liska's heart began to thump, but this time she knew what to do. She squeezed Slothy so hard, she imagined his fluff might come out. She smelled the flower, *SNIIIFF*, and cooled the soup, *WHOOOOSH*. 

Then, slowly, like a brave little snail, she stood up. She lifted one shaky paw, and its shadow appeared on the wall. Small and wobbly, but THERE.

It was almost touching the shadow claws. Liska's heart thumped faster, and her paw froze. 

"Come on, shadow paw," she whispered. "You're mine. Be brave."

She pushed her paw forward until her its shadow softly touched the plant shadow, and...

Nothing happened. No grabbing. Just her shadow paw on the shadow leaf. Her own paw was safe.

"You're not scary," she said. "You're just... another shadow! You can't DO anything!" 

Then Liska looked down at Slothy. "Oh, you're scared too?" she whispered, hugging him. "It's okay. We just do the flower-soup breath. In... and out. And now let's play!"

She held Slothy up and brought his shadow right up to the claw-shaped shadow. She moved it closer... closer... and suddenly gave the shadow claw a little high-five! *Pat*!

And there wasn't a claw after all. Just a shadow of her friend, Mr. Cheesy, wiggling in the wind.

Mama, watching from the doorway, smiled.

"Wow, you were so afraid of that spiky shadow, but you still found a way to play with it!"

Liska snuggled into her mother's paw and purred softly, "I love you, Mom."

She turned back to the shadows. 

"Good night, Mr. Cheesy," she whispered. "Tomorrow, we'll play again."
