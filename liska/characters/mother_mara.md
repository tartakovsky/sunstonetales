# Arcane speciality

**Healer, Mind Mender**

Mara manipulates arcane energy fields to stimulate and accelerate the body's natural healing processes and calm emotional disturbances. This ability manifests visibly as a subtle silver-blue glow emanating from her paw pads when activated, and requires significant focus and energy, limiting how many patients she can treat in a day.
