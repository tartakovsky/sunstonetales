## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere

#### Page 1
<!-- Image: Liska sits down in the sunny corner. Engaged, positive, concentrated expression. Blep on her face. Weaving the braid. Small treasures on it.  -->

<!-- RU: Одним солнечным утром, сидя в своем любимом уголке сада, Лиска укрощала дикую упрямую косичку. -->
One sunny morning, in her favorite corner of the garden Liska was taming a wild, stubborn braid. 

Her tiny tongue stuck out just a little as she wove her favorite treasures into it.

Finally, she gave the braid one last, tight tug, and everything was snug.

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up

#### Page 2
<!-- Image: Close up of the braid with treasures -->

<!-- Too long, but very good. -->
First, she gently touched the rainbow stone. "Papa gave you to me," she said, "to help me be brave."

Next, she tickled her nose with the tuft of snow-white baby-fur. "Mama saved you from when I was tiny," she whispered, "because she loves me very, very much."

And last, she pointed a claw at the tiny clay tablet. "This one," she said proudly, "is me! My first mark."

She remembered Papa and Mama pressing their paws over hers as she made it. It was like pile of paws.

"There. Now you're all together."

She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

#### Page 3
<!-- Image: Liska in the doorway, stopped, wide eyes, unpleasant surprise. Father and mother stiff -->

She bounded into the main room, but Papa, who always turned at the sound of her paws, didn’t move. Mama, who always had a smile waiting, kept her face turned to the wall.

She stopped.

*Something's wrong,* a little voice whispered in her head.

The room was so quiet, Liska could hear a bee buzzing outside the window.


### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident

#### Page 4
<!-- Image: Liska miffed, ears a bit down. More confused than sad. -->
A happy little hum in Liska’s chest went quiet. Her tail, which had been swishing with excitement, gave a confused thump-thump against her legs and then fell still. Why didn't they look at her?

<!-- CRITIQUE: Not bad, But it only shows cat-specific imagery and the tail action, which is cute but not relatable to human child. So it would be nice to use body tails and emotional experiences that are relatable. -->

---

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)

#### Page 5
<!-- Image: Liska and Papa. She holds out her braid hesitantly. Papa doesn't pay attention -->
She padded over to Papa and held up her braid. "Papa, look what I made."

He glanced down. "That's nice, sweetie." His eyes were already looking back out the window. Liska flinched, as if pricked by a thorn.

<!-- CRITIQUE: The simile "as if pricked by a thorn" is another tired cliché for emotional pain. It tells the reader Liska is hurt instead of showing it through a more unique, physical reaction. -->

#### Page 6

<!-- Image: Liska stands in front of father. Determined expression. Holds the braid up to his face. Talks to him.  -->
She stepped right in front of him, blocking his view and lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us."

#### Page 7
<!-- Image: Papa holds her paw with two paws, lookes her in the eyes, frowns, says not right now / mixed with father holds her by the shoulders, turning her away, slightly pushing her back -->

Papa looked at her, but his face was tight and serious. He put a paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now." 

His paw pushed hers softly away.

<!-- CRITIQUE: This is functional but lacks any specific detail to make it memorable. The interaction is generic. -->

### Beat 3.2: Low Point

#### Page 8
<!-- Image: -->

<!-- One line of her feelings/body tells before she runs away -->

She fled to the hallway. She sank to the floor and wrapped her arms around her knees, making herself as small as possible. 

*Are they mad at ME?* she thought.

The treasure-braid felt heavy and useless in her lap.

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

#### Page 9
<!-- I'm not sure that just sitting there quietly is a good thing to do. Maybe it is, but we'll need to check developmentally whether that's how he should have co-regulated—sitting quietly or talking or whatever.. -->

A moment later, she felt a heavy, warm paw on her back. It was Papa. He sat down close, his body a big, warm, safe presence, until her sharp sobs softened into quiet hiccups.

<!-- CRITIQUE: The description is laden with generic adjectives ("heavy, warm, big, safe"). The phrase "his body a big, warm, safe presence" explicitly tells the reader the feeling of safety instead of evoking it through Liska's perspective. -->

#### Page 10
<!-- Image: -->

"I see you are very sad," he said softly. "Mama and I... we are arguing. But it is not your fault, little one, we love you." 

He squeezed her gently. "Mama and I need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" 

#### Page 11
<!-- Image: Papa gives her a small sad smile while going away.  -->

Liska nodded.

"Thank you," Papa said softly. "Where would be a cozy spot for you to wait?"

Liska stood, took his big paw, and led him to her sunny corner. She settled herself into the pillows, and Papa tucked them in around her before walking back into the house.


### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation
#### Page 14
<!-- Image: Liska still sad, looks at the braid on the floor, touches it -->

For a long moment, Liska just sat there, tracing the treasures on her braid with one paw. 

She placed the soft fur on top of the solid stone. Then she balanced her little clay mark on the very top. A tiny treasure-tower. 

<!-- CRITIQUE: The action of stacking the treasures feels coincidental and lacks engagement. It's a very quiet, internal moment that conveniently leads to the solution without much active problem-solving from the character. -->

#### Page 15
<!-- Image: Liska, thinking expression, thought bubble, paw pile in them -->

Her ears perked up. It looked just like... their family paw pile! How they'd stack all their paws together and laugh. 

#### Page 16
<!-- Image: Liska's expression changes from thoughtful to determined. She gets up. -->

She looked from her own small paw to the treasure-braid. Then she looked toward the doorway, where her parents were. 

She snatched the braid up, scrambled to her paws, and marched back into the room.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

#### Page 17
<!-- Image: Liska stands between parents, braid held up in one paw. Other points at it. She declares. -->

She walked right between her parents, stood as tall as she could, and held up the braid. "LOOK!" she declared. "It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me! All together! Look!"

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback
#### Page 18
<!-- Image: Parents look each other in the eye? Liska frozen with expectant/anxious expression? -->

Her parents just stared. 

For a scary second, nothing happened.

<!-- Describe anxiousness onset -->

<!-- then "Need them to be together!" thought that pushes her into action -->

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested -> Learned Skill -> Persistence
#### Page 19
<!-- Image: Liska pulling Papa's paw with effort toward mother -->

Then, she took a tiny, shaky breath, and grabbed Papa's paw. She grunted and pulled him toward Mama with all her might. 

#### Page 20
<!-- Image: Liska pulled Papa toward Mama. Now she grabbed Mama's paw. Holds both their paws, puts them one on top the other, holding parent's wrists. Parents look each other in the eye -->

Then she grabbed Mama's paw. She joined their paws and placed her own little paw right on top.

#### Page 21
<!-- Image: Liska's paw on top of theirs, she commands with determined expression. Parents look at her. -->

"Paw pile," she commanded, her voice small but stubborn. "Us. Together."

### Beat 4.4: Success
#### Page 22
<!-- Image: Parents kneeling down, both hugging Liska. Mama's face buried into Liska's top of the head. Relief and joy on Liska's face -->

Something in parents' eyes melted. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug.

"We're so sorry we worried you," Mama whispered into her fur.

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief
#### Page 23
<!-- Image: their faces together in a triple kiss -->

<!-- CRITIQUE: The "Triple Kiss" is a charming, specific detail. However, the final line, "and the feeling of everything being right again," is telling the reader the emotional state instead of letting them infer it from the sensory details of the kiss. 

- ANSWER: Agree

-->

<!-- A bit abrupt, needs lead-in line -->
They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss—all three noses touching in the middle. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

---

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning
#### Page 24
<!-- Image: Sunny corner, they lie together as a sandwich, paws in a paw pile -->

<!-- CRITIQUE: The time skip ("Later") is jarring and breaks the narrative flow from the emotional peak of the climax. The story should transition more smoothly into this resolution scene. The "family sandwich" image itself is effective and endearing. 

- ANSWER: Agree
-->

Later they sat in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring family sandwich.

#### Page 25
<!-- Image: idk what facial expression Liska has, but should be something thoughtful. Papa nuzzles her ear. They are sitting up to differ from the previous scene? -->

<!-- CRITIQUE: The dialogue here is too didactic. "I made us remember" is an overly self-aware statement for a young child. Papa's response reinforces the feeling of a lesson being taught to the reader. It also misses the opportunity for process praise, instead focusing on the outcome. 

- ANSWER: Not sure I agree here, but something to think about. I kind of agree that it's on the edge of being overly self-aware. My child at 5 can say it, but yeah. But also pay attention that the whole bit here is about reflexion, so there should be some way for a character to understand what they did.
-->
<!-- CRITIQUE: I agree with the original critique. Liska's statement is too cognitively advanced. Papa's response is personal praise ("You helped us"), not process praise, and it sounds like a moral being delivered to the reader. -->
She looked at their paws, all stacked in a pile.

"I made us remember," she said quietly, and a little purr rumbled in her throat.

Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most."

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo
#### Page 26
<!-- Image: Liska in the sunny corner of the garder. Looks at father and mother talking. -->
<!-- CRITIQUE: Another unnecessary "Later" and a repetition of the "sunny corner" setting. This creates a sluggish and repetitive feel in the resolution. While modeling the parental apology is good, Liska's role is entirely passive (overhearing), which weakens her agency at the end of the story. 

- ANSWER: Agree
-->

Later, from her sunny corner, Liska watched her parents talking softly.

"I'm sorry I was grumpy," said Papa.

"And I'm sorry I was cold," Mama's voice replied, soft again.

#### Page 27
<!-- Image: Mother sits on the cushions near the pond. Father brings her a cup, touches her shoulder, they look each other in the eyes, happy -->

She saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. As he set it down, he touched Mama's shoulder, and Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes.

<!-- CRITIQUE: The story's focus shifts completely to the parents, making Liska a spectator in her own story. This ending fails to center the protagonist's experience and growth. -->


### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
#### Page 28
<!-- Image: Liska touching the braid on her waist, looking at it, content expression -->
<!-- CRITIQUE: The ending is weak because it summarizes the entire story. Another time skip ("The next morning"), the final repetition of "Stone, fur, clay," and an explicit statement of the theme ("brave enough to bring them all together"). This is telling at its most blatant and uses personal praise ("brave") against the established guidelines. The story should end on an emotional, resonant image, not a summary. 

- ANSWER: I'm not sure I agree that it should not end on a summary. To me, it kinda sounds like a conclusion should be a summary, tying it all together. But something to think about again.
-->
<!-- CRITIQUE: This ending is entirely didactic. It explicitly tells the reader the moral of the story. The phrase "brave enough to bring them all together" is personal praise ("brave") and summarizes the plot instead of leaving the reader with a resonant image or feeling. It undermines the entire narrative by boiling it down to a simplistic lesson. -->
The next morning, Liska played in the garden. Her treasure-braid swung at her side. Stone, fur, clay. Her family. And her, brave enough to bring them all together.
