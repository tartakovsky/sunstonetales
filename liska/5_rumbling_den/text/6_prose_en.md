## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere

#### Page 1
<!-- Image: Liska sits down in the sunny corner. Engaged, positive, concentrated expression. Blep on her face. Weaving the braid. Small treasures on it.  -->

<!-- RU: Одним солнечным утром, сидя в своем любимом уголке сада, Лиска укрощала дикую упрямую косичку. -->
One sunny morning, in her favorite garden corner, Liska was taming a stubborn braid.

Her tiny tongue stuck out as she wove her favorite treasures into it.

She gave the braid one last tug, and everything was snug.

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up

#### Page 2
<!-- Image: Close up of the braid with treasures -->

<!-- Too long, but very good. Keep it like this -->
First, she touched the rainbow stone. "Papa gave you to me," she said, "to help me be brave."

Next, she tickled her nose with the tuft of snow-white baby-fur. "Mama saved you from when I was tiny," she whispered, "because she loves me so very, very much."

And last, she pointed to the tiny clay tablet. "And this," she said proudly, "is me! My first mark."

She remembered Papa and Mama pressing their paws over hers as she made it. A pile of paws!

"There. Now you're all together," said Liska.

She had to show Mama and Papa *right now*!

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

#### Page 3
<!-- Image: Liska in the doorway, stopped, wide eyes, unpleasant surprise. Father and mother stiff -->

She bounded into the main room, but Papa, who always turned at the sound of her paws, didn’t move. Mama, who always had a smile waiting, kept her face to the wall.

Liska stopped.

*Something's wrong,* she thought.

The room was so quiet, she could hear a bee buzzing outside.


### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident

#### Page 4
<!-- Image: Liska miffed, ears a bit down. More confused than sad. -->
The happy hum in her chest went quiet. Her tail gave a confused thump-thump and fell still. 

Why didn't they look at her?

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)

#### Page 5
<!-- Image: Liska and Papa. She holds out her braid hesitantly. Papa doesn't pay attention -->

She padded over to Papa and held up her braid. "Papa, look what I made."

He glanced down. "That's nice, sweetie." His eyes went back to the window.

Liska blinked once, slow. Her smile slid right off her face.


#### Page 6

<!-- Image: Liska stands in front of father. Determined expression. Holds the braid up to his face. Talks to him.  -->
She stepped right in front of him, lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us."

#### Page 7
<!-- Image: Papa holds her paw with two paws, lookes her in the eyes, frowns, says not right now / mixed with father holds her by the shoulders, turning her away, slightly pushing her back -->

Papa looked at her, but his face was tight and serious. He put a paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now." 

His paw pushed hers softly away.

Hot tears stung her eyes. Her chest felt too tight to breathe.

### Beat 3.2: Low Point

#### Page 8
<!-- Image: -->

She fled to the hallway, sank to the floor and hugged her knees, making herself as small as possible. 

*Are they mad at ME?* she thought.

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

#### Page 9
A heavy, warm paw settled on her back. Papa gathered her into his chest, and Liska buried herself in his fur like a deep, warm burrow. He held her tight until the shaking stopped.

#### Page 10
<!-- Image: -->

"Oh, my kitten, you are so sad," he said softly. "Mama and I... we are arguing. But it is not your fault, little one, we love you." 

He squeezed her gently. "Mama and I need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" 

#### Page 11
<!-- Image: Papa gives her a small sad smile while going away.  -->

Liska nodded.

"Thank you," Papa said softly. "Where would be a cozy spot for you to wait?"

Liska led him to her sunny corner. She settled into the pillows, and Papa tucked them around her before walking back inside.


### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation
#### Page 14
<!-- Image: Liska still sad, looks at the braid on the floor, touches it -->

For a long moment, Liska just sat there, tracing the treasures on her braid with one paw, moving them around.

She placed the soft fur on the solid stone. Then balanced her clay mark on top. A tiny treasure-tower. Then...

#### Page 15
<!-- Image: Liska, thinking expression, thought bubble, paw pile in them -->

Her ears perked up. It looked just like... their family paw pile! How they'd stack their paws together and laugh. 

#### Page 16
<!-- Image: Liska's expression changes from thoughtful to determined. She gets up. -->

She looked at her paw, then the braid, then the doorway...

She snatched the braid up, scrambled to her paws, and marched back into the room.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

#### Page 17
<!-- Image: Liska stands between parents, braid held up in one paw. Other points at it. She declares. -->

She walked right between her parents, stood as tall as she could, and held up the braid. "LOOK!" she declared. "It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me! All together! Look!"

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback
#### Page 18
<!-- Image: Parents look each other in the eye? Liska frozen with expectant/anxious expression? -->

For a scary second, nothing happened.

Her eyes darted back and forth. Papa here. Mama there... wa-a-ay over there.

*Too far apart!* Liska thought. *I have to put them back!*


### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested -> Learned Skill -> Persistence
#### Page 19
<!-- Image: Liska pulling Papa's paw with effort toward mother -->

She took a shaky breath, grabbed Papa's paw, and pulled him toward Mama with all her might. 

#### Page 20
<!-- Image: Liska pulled Papa toward Mama. Now she grabbed Mama's paw. Holds both their paws, puts them one on top the other, holding parent's wrists. Parents look each other in the eye -->

Then she grabbed Mama's paw. She joined their paws and placed her own little paw right on top.

#### Page 21
<!-- Image: Liska's paw on top of theirs, she commands with determined expression. Parents look at her. -->

"Paw pile," she commanded, her voice small but stubborn. "Us. Together."

### Beat 4.4: Success
#### Page 22
<!-- Image: Parents kneeling down, both hugging Liska. Mama's face buried into Liska's top of the head. Relief and joy on Liska's face -->

Something in their eyes melted. In a rush of warm fur, they knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug.

"We're so sorry we worried you," Mama whispered into her fur.

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief
#### Page 23
<!-- Image: their faces together in a triple kiss -->

Then came the best part: they smooshed their faces together for their special Triple Kiss, noses touching.

Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning
#### Page 24
After a moment, Liska looked up. “Your voices got crunchy,” she said, tapping their paws. “Paw pile fixes it.”

#### Page 25
She tugged them, pulling their tangle of fur into her sunny corner.

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo
#### Page 26
There, they settled in a heap, Liska the warm filling in a purring family sandwich.

#### Page 27
"I'm sorry I was grumpy," said Papa.

"And I'm sorry I was cold," said Mama, her voice soft again.


### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
#### Page 28
Liska looked at the braid, then at their paws. Today she was like that braid, holding the family together.
