# Add cover images to stories listing page

**Date:** 2026-02-09 12:52
**Scope:** landing/src/app/[locale]/stories/page.tsx

## Summary
Stories listing page now shows cover images from R2 at 8:10 aspect ratio in a responsive grid, matching the homepage story grid layout.

## Decisions Made
- Reused the exact same card layout from `story-grid.tsx` (AspectRatio 8/10, Image fill, fallback emoji)
- Changed from single-column list to responsive grid (1 col → 2 col → 3 col)
- Removed `max-w-4xl` constraint since the grid needs full container width
