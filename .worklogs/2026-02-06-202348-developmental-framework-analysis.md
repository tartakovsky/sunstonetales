# Analysis of 3_Developmental_Framework.md for Liska Adventures

**Date:** 2026-02-06 20:23
**Scope:** `context/core_rules/3_Developmental_Framework.md` → `prompts/writing_style.md`

## Summary
Analyzed the ~920-line developmental framework and compressed it to a single paragraph of guiding philosophy.

## What was in the source file
- **15 developmental rules**: Process praise, growth language, co-regulation, emotion validation, clear labels, Notice-Pause-Help, child agency, socratic guidance, child choice, process focus, natural consequences, perspective-taking, learning frame
- **18 dysregulation types**: Matrix of with-parent/with-peers/alone × high distress/moderate/acting out/aggression/over-excited/withdrawn
- **20 coping strategies**: Body calming (tree pose, breathing, stomping), mind calming (self-talk, visualization), showing feelings (drawing, talking), teamwork strategies (help signals, comfort items)
- **30 support types**: Calm presence, physical contact, validation, active listening, gentle guidance, etc.
- **13 solution discovery processes**: Guided discovery, trial/error, brainstorming, observational learning, creative reframing, etc.
- **18 practice types**: Mental rehearsal, pretend play, adult modeling, step-by-step breakdown, etc.

## Decision

### Keep the psychology, drop the prescription
- **Chose:** One paragraph establishing developmental psychology as a lens, not a checklist
- **Why:** The old file was a therapy playbook — every dysregulation type mapped to specific coping strategies and support flows. This was necessary for dumber models writing psychological stories. For adventures with a smart model, we want the psychology to be *present but invisible*. The model knows developmental psychology best practices. Telling it "you're writing from this perspective" is enough to activate that knowledge.
- **Key principles extracted:** Child agency (adults guide not fix), emotion validation, natural consequences, growth through action not dialogue, non-didactic
- **Everything else dropped:** Dysregulation type matrices, coping strategy menus, regulation flow charts, support type catalogs, practice type lists, solution discovery processes — all too prescriptive for adventure stories

## Note
Old file remains in place for the psychological story pipeline. No source files modified.
