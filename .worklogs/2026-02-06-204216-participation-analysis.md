**Date:** 2026-02-06 20:42
**Scope:** `context/core_rules/6_Participation.md` → `prompts/writing_style.md`

## Summary
Extracted one line from the participation/immersion file. The key principle is no fourth-wall breaks.

## What was in the source file
6 immersive interaction techniques without breaking the fourth wall:
1. Character searches / reader sees (dramatic irony via illustrations)
2. Environmental uncertainty / visual resolution
3. Shared sensory experience
4. Character posing internal questions
5. In-world riddles or symbols
6. Foreshadowing / visual echoes

## Decision
- **Chose:** One line in Story Structure: "Use reader engagement and immersive interaction techniques that don't break the fourth wall."
- **Why:** Most techniques in the file are either illustration-dependent or standard good writing. The non-obvious principle is the fourth-wall constraint — it's a real design choice (we could go either way) so it's worth stating. The specific techniques don't need listing.

## Key Files
- `context/core_rules/6_Participation.md` — source (unchanged)
- `prompts/writing_style.md` — one line added to Story Structure
