# Make site installable as PWA

**Date:** 2026-02-12 14:12
**Scope:** landing/src/app/manifest.ts, landing/public/sw.js, landing/public/icons/, landing/src/components/sw-register.tsx, landing/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx

## Summary
Added PWA support so the site can be installed on mobile (Chrome "Add to Home Screen") and runs without browser chrome in standalone mode.

## Decisions Made

### Next.js built-in manifest.ts
- **Chose:** `app/manifest.ts` dynamic manifest (official Next.js approach)
- **Why:** Built-in support, no extra dependencies. Generates `/manifest.webmanifest` at build time.

### Minimal service worker
- **Chose:** Empty fetch handler in `public/sw.js`
- **Why:** Chrome requires a registered service worker for the install prompt. No offline caching needed for now — the site is a static content reader.

### display: standalone with dark background
- **Chose:** `display: standalone`, `background_color: #1a1714`, `theme_color: #1a1714`
- **Why:** Standalone removes browser chrome. Dark colors match the site's dark theme.

### start_url: /ru/stories
- **Chose:** Russian stories page as the entry point
- **Why:** Primary audience is Russian-speaking, stories page is the main content.
