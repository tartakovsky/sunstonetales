# Fix Railway deployment — remove serverExternalPackages

**Date:** 2026-02-09 10:03
**Scope:** landing/next.config.ts

## Summary
Removed `serverExternalPackages: ["postgres"]` from next.config.ts. The `postgres` package is pure JS (no native bindings) and should be bundled by Next.js, not treated as external. Railway deployments were failing at "Deploy > Create container" with "Failed to create deployment" — likely because the external package wasn't available in the standalone container.

## Context & Problem
After pushing the annotation system commit, Railway deployments failed 3 times. Build succeeded but container creation failed. The `serverExternalPackages` config tells Next.js standalone output NOT to bundle the package, expecting it in node_modules — but the standalone output has a minimal node_modules that may not include it.
