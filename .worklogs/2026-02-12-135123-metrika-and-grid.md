# Add Yandex Metrika and fix story grid layout

**Date:** 2026-02-12 13:51
**Scope:** landing/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx, landing/src/components/landing/story-grid.tsx, landing/package.json

## Summary
Integrated Yandex Metrika analytics using `next-yandex-metrica` library (same approach as steady-parent project). Fixed story grid to always show 2 columns and removed description truncation.

## Decisions Made

### Yandex Metrika via next-yandex-metrica library
- **Chose:** `next-yandex-metrica` package with `YandexMetricaProvider` wrapping children in locale layout
- **Why:** Handles script injection, noscript fallback, and automatic hit tracking on client-side navigation via `usePathname`. Same approach used in steady-parent project.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Manual inline script + custom usePathname component — rejected, reinventing what the library does

### Story grid always 2 columns
- **Chose:** `grid-cols-2` instead of `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`
- **Why:** Pixel Fold inner screen (~585px) was getting 1 column when 2 fit easily. Tailwind `sm` breakpoint is 640px.

### Remove description clamp
- **Chose:** Removed `line-clamp-3` from story description
- **Why:** Descriptions were getting cut off, user wants full text visible
