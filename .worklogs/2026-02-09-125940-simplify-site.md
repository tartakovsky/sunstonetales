# Simplify site: stories on root, minimal nav

**Date:** 2026-02-09 12:59
**Scope:** landing/src/app/[locale]/page.tsx, landing/src/components/landing/navbar.tsx

## Summary
Root page now shows the stories grid directly (no landing page). Navbar stripped to logo + language toggle only. About page still exists but is unlinked.

## Decisions Made
- Root page renders same content as `/stories` (cover image grid, sorted by date)
- Removed Stories and About links from navbar
- Kept about page in filesystem (not deleted, just unlinked)
- `/stories` route still works as before (both routes show the same content)
