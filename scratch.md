One morning, Mama and Liska squeezed something enormous through the bedroom door. 

"Just... a... little... more!" Mama grunted, pushing the heavy pot.

Liska anchored her little feet, grabbed a giant leaf, and pulled with a mighty little "Hnngh!".

With a final push — SKWEEEAK! — in came their new monstera plant, its leaves full of holes, just like Swiss cheese.

"It's a friendly cheese plant! - Liska declared - I name it Mr. Cheesy!" Her pink nose poked through a leaf-hole like a tiny curious button.

That afternoon, Liska made the shadow her new playmate. "High-five!" she giggled, slapping her palm against a big leaf-shadow. The wind moved the plant's leaves, and the shadow moved away. Liska went *SQUEEEE* and chased it down for another high-five.

As night fell, Mama tucked Liska in tight as a cinnamon roll. A gust of wind made plant's shadow stretch and sway with the branches outside.

The leaf-shadows grew longer... and longer... until they didn't look like leaves anymore. Now they looked like claws!

Liska's eyes widened. *It's just Mr. Cheesy.* She pulled the blanket over her head. "Go away," she whispered. "You're just a plant."

But under the blanket her imagination took over. What if the shadow crept closer? What if it touched her? What if— 

Her heart started to beat very fast: BA-DUM, BA-DUM. BA-DUM, BA-DUM.

She threw the blanket off. The shadow claws stretched long. It looked as if they were grasping... grasping for HER!

Liska scrambled out of bed, flew down the hall, and crashed into her mother's legs. "MAMA!" she sobbed. "The shadow has CLAWS and it wants to GRAB ME!"

Mama scooped her up. "Oh, sweet kitten, you're so scared" she murmured.

She carried her back to the bedroom and they peeked inside.

"You're right" - Mama said - "That shadow does look like claws."

Liska nodded, leaving tears and maybe a little snot on Mama's nightgown. 

As Mama tucked Liska back into bed, Mama's paws moved into the moonlight. 

A shadow butterfly appeared on the wall. Mama made it fly closer to the plant's shadow and circle a leafy claw. 

Liska watched, her eyes wide. The shadow butterfly was... beautiful? Not scary? 

"It's like they're dancing," she whispered. 

The next evening, Liska asked, "Ma-am, I'm still scared of the shadow. Can you help me?"

"Of course, kitten," her mother answered. "How does your body feel?"

"My heart is going thump-thump, thump-thump"

"Then let's help it calm down," her mother said. "Breath in like you smell a big flower... Liska took a slow *sniff* in... and breathe out like you cool down the hot soup... and a long *whoooosh* out."

"Mama," Liska said, "remember the butterfly you made? I wanna do it too."

Mama helped her fold her paws, and a wobbly butterfly appeared on the wall.

Mama pointed to the watering-can shadow wiggling in the lamplight. "Looks like a grumpy elephant," she whispered. "I bet his trunk is ticklish!"

Liska made her butterfly circle the trunk once... twice... and... zipped in to bop it on the snoot!

The trunk-shadow wobbled, and a tiny *snort* escaped Liska. The trunk looked like it wanted to dance.

A new thought sparked inside her: *Ooh! I can make them dance!*

The night came, and Mr. Cheesy's shadow again stretched across the wall. Liska's heart began to thump. But this time was different. Clutching her sloth until she worried his stuffing might pop, she smelled the flower, *SNIIIFF*, and cooled the soup, *WHOOOOSH*. 

Slowly, like a brave little snail, she stood up. She lifted one shaky paw and it's shadow appeared on the wall. Small and wobbly, but THERE. 

It was almost touching the shadow claws. Liska's heart thumped faster and her paw froze. 

"Come on, shadow paw," she whispered. "You're mine. Be brave."

She stubbornly pushed her paw forward. Her shadow touched the plant shadow, and...

Nothing happened. No grabbing, no eating. Just her shadow-paw on the shadow-leaf.

"You're not scary," she said. "You're just... another shadow! You can't DO anything!" 

Then Liska noticed Slothy hiding under her arm. "Oh, you're scared too?" she whispered, hugging him. "It's okay. We just do the flower-soup breath. In... and out."

"And now LET'S FIGHT THE SHADOW CHEESE MONSTER!"

She aimed Slothy's shadow at the tip of a leafy claw. She edged it closer... closer... and suddently gave the shadow claw a giant high-five! *TAP.*

There was no monster. Just her friend, Mr. Cheesy, wiggling back.

Mama, watching from the doorway, smiled. "I see we have brave new shadow dancers in here."

Liska nuzzled into her mother's hand purred softly: "We won".

Next night, when the shadows grew long again, Liska snuggled with Slothy. She was ready. "Come on, Mr. Cheesy," she whispered. "Let's dance."
