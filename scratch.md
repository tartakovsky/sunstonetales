In a sunny corner of the garden, where the air smelled like warm earth and honeybees buzzed over clover, Liska sat with her treasures. 

She worked with great care, her little brow furrowed in concentration as she finished a small, thick braid. 

Woven into it was a rainbow 'courage stone' from Papa, a tuft of her own white baby-fur saved by Mama, and a tiny clay tablet with her very first paw-print. Her first mark on the world. 

She held it up to the light, then whispered to the treasures, "There. Now you're all safe together."

Her treasure-braid was finally done. Liska hugged it tight and bounced on her paws, her tail wiggling. She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

Liska bounded into the main room and skidded to a stop. 

Papa stood by the window, his tail as stiff as a stick. Mama sat far away, her face turned to the wall.

Liska hesitated. Papa's voice was a low rumble. "I just don't understand why."

From across the room, Mama's voice was a sharp whisper. "I can't talk about this now."

Liska's ears drooped. The happy wiggle in her tail stopped. A tight little squeeze took hold of her chest, making it hard to breathe.

She padded over to Papa and held up her braid. "Papa, look what I made."

He glanced down. "That's nice, sweetie." His eyes were already looking back out the window. Liska flinched, as if pricked by a thorn.

She stepped right in front of him, blocking his view and lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us."

Papa looked at her but his gaze was stormy. He put a paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now." 

His paw pushed hers softly away. Liska's breath caught in her throat.

Liska sniffed and ran out of the room. She collapsed in the hallway, curling into the tiniest, tightest ball she could make. Her whole body shook with big, gulpy sobs that came from deep in her belly. She pressed her face into her paws, wanting to disappear right into the floor.

Papa's warm shadow fell over her. He sat on the floor and rested a heavy, warm paw on her back, saying nothing. He just sat with her, breathing slowly, until her big sobs turned into little hiccups.

"I see you are very sad," he said softly. "Mama and I... we are very angry. But it is not your fault, little one, we love you." He squeezed her gently. "Can you do something for me? Hold your special braid and take one deep, slow breath, like we practiced. Can you do that while we finish talking?" He helped her sit up and hugged her. Liska nodded into his shoulder. Papa squezeed her one last time and went back to the room.

Her hiccups slowly quieted. For a long moment, she just sat there, tracing the treasures on her braid with one paw. The stone felt solid, like Papa. The fur felt soft, like Mama. The clay felt warm, like home. *Together*. 

A tiny spark of an idea began to glow. 

She remembered their family paw pile... How they'd stack all their paws and laugh.

Liska marched back into the room. 

She planted her feet between her parents and held up the braid. "LOOK!" she declared. "It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me!"

Her parents just stared. The room went so quiet Liska could hear her own heartbeat, a fast, strong thumping in her chest.

That prickly, sad feeling started to creep back into her chest. 

She took a tiny, shaky breath, and grabbed Papa's paw. She pulled him toward Mama with all her might. 

Then she grabbed Mama's paw. She joined their paws and placed her own little paw right on top.

"Paw pile," she commanded, her voice small but stubborn. "Us. Together."

Something in parents' eyes melted. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug.

"We're so sorry we worried you," Mama whispered into her fur.

They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss—all three noses touching in the middle. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

They sat together in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring family sandwich. 

She looked at their paws, still stacked together.

"I made us remember," she said quietly, a proud little puff in her chest.

Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most."

Later, from her sunny corner, Liska watched her parents talking softly.

"I'm sorry I was so sharp," said Papa.

"And I'm sorry I went so quiet," Mama's voice replied, warm as honey.

She saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. As he set it down, he touched Mama's shoulder, and Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes.

Her treasure-braid swung at her side as she played. Stone, fur, clay. Her family. And her, brave enough to bring them all together.
