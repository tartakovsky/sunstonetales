# Goal: Narrative Polish & Deepening

This step is the final polish before prose generation. Your role is to be a meticulous narrative editor, scrutinizing the storyboard from every angle to ensure it is tight, psychologically sound, and maximally engaging. You will refine the narrative flow, deepen character moments, and ensure all thematic and developmental elements are perfectly integrated.

**Input:** The Narrative Storyboard from Step 4.
**Output:** A polished and finalized Narrative Storyboard, ready for prose generation.

## Core Tasks & Quality Gates:

For each beat, you must analyze and refine the following aspects. Your output for each beat should be a revised `Narrative Text` and `Suggestions`

1.  **Narrative Tightness & Pacing:**
    *   **Action:** Edit for conciseness. Is the sequence of events logical and compelling? Cut or rephrase anything that slows the pace unnecessarily.

2.  **Psychological & Emotional Arc:**
    *   **Action:** Verify the psychological sequence. Ensure the "show, then tell" method is correctly applied (describe physical sensations, then name the emotion). Detail the specific co-regulation steps in recovery beats and the character's internal reflections.
    *   **Rationale:** Explain how the beat now better represents the intended emotional journey and developmental lessons.

3.  **Character & World Integrity:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure character actions and dialogue are consistent with their established traits and fun profiles. Refine environmental descriptions to enhance mood and theme. Check that metaphors are introduced and used correctly.

4.  **Engagement & "Fun Factor":**
    *   **Action:** Sprinkle in fun, micro-tensions, and evocative language. Ensure the fun is character-specific. The goal is to make the story delightful to read aloud.
    *   **Rationale:** Pinpoint the specific additions that increase engagement.

## Output Structure

Maintain the identical structural format from `five_act_4_to_6_yo.md`, including Act and Beat structure, number, and names.

For each beat, provide the following:

1.  **Narrative Text:** The revised, polished description of the scene's events. **This is a storyboard description, NOT final prose.**
2.  **Suggestions:** A quoted block detailing the suggestions you propose to improve the beat

### Output Format Example

## Act X
### Beat X.Y

**Narrative Text:**
Liska attempts to wrap her tail in a large leaf, but it's crinkly and falls off. She huffs in frustration, her ears flattening for a moment.

> **Suggestions:**
> - **Pacing:** Let's combine the action of wrapping the leaf and it falling off into a single, quicker sentence to keep the pace brisk.
> - **Psychology:** To better show the rising frustration, let's add a small physical tell right after the leaf falls off, like "her tail gives a sharp *thump* on the ground."
> - **Engagement:** We can make the failure funnier by having the leaf be comically oversized for her tail.
