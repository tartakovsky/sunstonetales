One morning, Mama and Liska squeezed something enormous through the bedroom door. 

"Just... a... little... more!" Mama grunted, pushing the heavy pot.

Liska anchored her little feet, grabbed a giant leaf, and pulled with a mighty little "Hnngh!".

With a final push — SKWEEEAK! — in came their new monstera plant, its leaves full of holes, just like Swiss cheese.

"It's a friendly cheese plant! - Liska declared - I name it Mr. Cheesy!" Her pink nose poked through a leaf-hole like a tiny curious button.

That afternoon, Liska made the shadow her new playmate. "High-five!" she giggled, slapping her palm against a big leaf-shadow on the wall. The wind moved the plant's leaves, and the shadow danced away. Liska went *SQUEEEE*, ready to chase it down for another high-five.

As night fell, Mama tucked Liska in tight as a cinnamon roll. A gust of wind made plant's shadow stretch and sway with the branches outside.

The friendly leaves grew longer... and longer... until they didn't look like leaves anymore. Now they looked like claws!

---

Liska's eyes widened. *It's just Mr. Cheesy.* She pulled the blanket over her head. "Go away," she whispered. "You're just a plant."

But under the blanket her imagination took over. What if the shadow crept across the floor? What if it touched her blanket? What if— 

Her heart started to beat very fast: BA-DUM, BA-DUM. BA-DUM, BA-DUM.

She threw the blanket off. The shadow's arms stretched long against the wall. It looked as if they were grasping... grasping for HER!

Liska scrambled out of bed, flew down the hall, and crashed into her mother's legs. "MAMA!" she sobbed. "The shadow has CLAWS and it wants to GRAB ME!"

Mama scooped her up. "Oh, sweet kitten, you're so scared" she murmured, holding Liska close. 

She carried her back to the bedroom and they peeked inside.

"You're right" - Mama said - "That shadow does look like claws."

Liska nodded, leaving a wet patch of tears and maybe a little snot on Mama's nightgown. 

As Mama tucked Liska back into bed, Mama's paws moved into the moonlight. 

A shadow butterfly appeared on the wall. She made it fly closer to the plant's shadow and circle a leafy claw. 

Liska watched, her eyes wide. The shadow butterfly was... beautiful? Not scary? 

"It's like they're dancing," she whispered. 

The next evening, Liska asked, "Ma-am, I'm still scared of the shadow. Can you help me?"

"Of course, kitten," her mother answered. "How does your body feel?"

"My heart is going thump-thump, thump-thump"

"I see," said her mother. "Then we need to help it calm down. Breath in like you smell a big flower... Liska took a slow *sniff* in... and breathe out like you cool down the hot soup... and a long *whoooosh* out."

"Mama," Liska said, "remember the bird you did? I wanna do it too."

"Of course!" Mama made a bird with her paws and landed it on the wall. 

She pointed to the watering-can shadow. "Look, it's like a grumpy elephant." she whispered, "I bet his trunk is ticklish. Do you think your shadow could sneak up and tickle it?"

Liska raised her finger, and its shadow became a sneaky spy. She made it creep across the wall, hide for a second behind a crack, and then... leaped out to bop the elephant right on the tip of its snoot!

The elephant shadow wiggled its trunk. Liska giggled. The grumpy elephant didn't seem so grumpy anymore. A new thought sparked inside her: I'm making them dance.

---

The night came, and Mr. Cheesy's shadow again crept across the wall. Liska's heart thumped nervously. But this time was different. Clutching her sloth until she worried his stuffing might pop, she took a slow *sniff* in and a long *whoooosh* out. 

Slowly, like a brave little snail, she stood up and crept toward the wall, lifting one shaky paw.

Her shadow appeared on the wall—small and wobbly, but THERE. Almost touching the plant's shadow. Her heart thumped again and her paw froze. 

"Come on, shadow paw," she whispered. "You're mine. Be brave. We're shadow dancers."

She stubbornly pushed her paw forward. Her shadow touched the plant shadow, and...

Nothing happened. No grabbing, no eating. Just her shadow-paw on the shadow-leaf.

"You're not scary," she said. "You're just... another shadow! You can't DO anything!" 

Then Liska noticed Slothy hiding under her arm. "Oh, you're scared too?" she whispered, hugging him. "It's okay. We just do the flower-soup breath. In... and out. Better, right?"

"And now LET'S FIGHT THE SHADOW CHEESE MONSTER!"

She made Slothy's shadow climb up the shadows's leafy claws. Higher and higher, until it reached the very top leaf.

There, it found a comfortable spot and gave a big, slow shadow-yawn.

The monster was gone. It became a bed in which a brave little hero slept peacefully. They won.

Mama, watching from the doorway, smiled. "I see we have brave new shadow dancers in here."

Liska watched the scene she had created with a small, proud smile on her face. 

Next night, when the shadows grew long again, Liska snuggled with Slothy. She was ready. "Come on, Mr. Cheesy," she whispered. "Let's dance."
