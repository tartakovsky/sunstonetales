"I will never save money, it's too hard!" Liska exclaimed.

"Why is it so hard?" her father asked.

"It's too hard to not spend when I want something!" Liska replied.

"That feeling like something pulls you, it's called temptation. Do you feel it at home as much?" her father inquired.

"No..." Liska admitted.

"I see. So at the market, the beads are for spending. What are they for when they are here, at home?" he continued.

"They are for saving! They need to stay home! We need a place to hide them!" Liska declared.
