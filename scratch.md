One sunny morning, in her favorite corner of the garden Liska was taming a wild, stubborn braid. 

Her tiny tongue stuck out just a little as she wove her favorite treasures into it.

Finally, she gave the braid one last, tight tug, and everything was snug.

First, she gently touched the rainbow stone. "Papa gave you to me," she said, "to help me be brave."

Next, she tickled her nose with the tuft of snow-white baby-fur. "Mama saved you from when I was tiny," she whispered, "because she loves me very, very much."

And last, she pointed a claw at the tiny clay tablet. "This one," she said proudly, "is me! My first mark."

She remembered Papa and Mama pressing their paws over hers as she made it. It was like pile of paws.

"There. Now you're all together."

She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

She bounded into the main room, but Papa, who always turned at the sound of her paws, didn’t move. Mama, who always had a smile waiting, kept her face turned to the wall.

She stopped.

*Something's wrong,* a little voice whispered in her head.

The room was so quiet, Liska could hear a bee buzzing outside the window.

A happy little hum in Liska’s chest went quiet. Her tail gave a confused thump-thump and fell still. Even her blinking forgot how to blink for a second.

Why didn't they look at her?

She padded over to Papa and held up her braid. "Papa, look what I made."

He glanced down. "That's nice, sweetie." His eyes were already looking back out the window. 

Liska blinked once, slow. Her smile slid right off her face.

She stepped right in front of him, blocking his view and lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us."

Papa looked at her, but his face was tight and serious. He put a paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now." 

His paw pushed hers softly away.

A hot prickle of tears stung her eyes, and her chest felt too tight to breathe.

She fled to the hallway. She sank to the floor and wrapped her arms around her knees, making herself as small as possible. 

*Are they mad at ME?* she thought.

The treasure-braid felt heavy and useless in her lap.

A heavy, warm paw settled on her back. It was Papa. He gathered her into his chest, and Liska buried herself in his fur like it was a deep, warm burrow. He held her tight until the shaking stopped.

"Oh, my kitten, you are so sad," he said softly. "Mama and I... we are arguing. But it is not your fault, little one, we love you." 

He squeezed her gently. "Mama and I need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" 

Liska nodded.

"Thank you," Papa said softly. "Where would be a cozy spot for you to wait?"

Liska stood, took his big paw, and led him to her sunny corner. She settled herself into the pillows, and Papa tucked them in around her before walking back into the house.

For a long moment, Liska just sat there, tracing the treasures on her braid with one paw, moving them around.

She placed the soft fur on top of the solid stone. Then she balanced her little clay mark on the very top. A tiny treasure-tower. Then...

Her ears perked up. It looked just like... their family paw pile! How they'd stack all their paws together and laugh. 

She looked from her own small paw to the treasure-braid. Then she looked toward the doorway, where her parents were. 

She snatched the braid up, scrambled to her paws, and marched back into the room.

She walked right between her parents, stood as tall as she could, and held up the braid. "LOOK!" she declared. "It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me! All together! Look!"

For a scary second, nothing happened.

Her eyes darted back and forth. Papa here. Mama there. Papa here. Mama... way over there.

*They just... too far apart!* Liska thought. *I have to put them back!*

Then, she took a tiny, shaky breath, and grabbed Papa's paw. She grunted and pulled him toward Mama with all her might. 

Then she grabbed Mama's paw. She joined their paws and placed her own little paw right on top.

"Paw pile," she commanded, her voice small but stubborn. "Us. Together."

Something in parents' eyes melted. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug.

"We're so sorry we worried you," Mama whispered into her fur.

Then came the best part.

They smooshed together for their special Triple Kiss: all three noses touching in the middle. 

Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

Still all tangled up in their hug, Liska took a big, shivery breath. The scary feeling slid away. Her purr came back, small and warm.

She looked at Mama. She looked at Papa. “Your voices got crunchy,” she said, and tapped their paws together. “Paw pile fixes it.”

She tugged Mama, then Papa, pulling their tangle of fur out into the garden.

They settled in a heap in their sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring family sandwich.

"I'm sorry I was grumpy," said Papa.

"And I'm sorry I was cold," said Mama, her voice soft again.

Liska looked at the braid, then at their paws. Today she was like that braid. The one that held the whole family together.
