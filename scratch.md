One sunny morning, in her favorite corner of the garden Liska was taming a wild, stubborn braid. 

Her tiny tongue stuck out just a little as she wove her favorite treasures into it.

Finally, she gave the braid one last, tight tug, and everything was snug.

First, she gently touched the rainbow stone. "Papa gave you to me," she said, "to help me be brave."

Next, she tickled her nose with the tuft of snow-white baby-fur. "Mama saved you from when I was tiny," she whispered, "because she loves me very, very much."

And last, she pointed a claw at the tiny clay tablet. "This one," she said proudly, "is me! My first mark."

She remembered Papa and Mama pressing their paws over hers as she made it. It was like pile of paws.

"There. Now you're all together."

She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

She bounded into the main room, but Papa, who always turned at the sound of her paws, didn’t move. Mama, who always had a smile waiting, kept her face turned to the wall.

She stopped.

*Something's wrong,* a little voice whispered in her head.

The room was so quiet, Liska could hear a bee buzzing outside the window.

A happy little hum in Liska’s chest went quiet. Her tail, which had been swishing with excitement, gave a confused thump-thump against her legs and then fell still. Why didn't they look at her?

She padded over to Papa and held up her braid. "Papa, look what I made."

He glanced down. "That's nice, sweetie." His eyes were already looking back out the window. Liska flinched, as if pricked by a thorn.

She stepped right in front of him, blocking his view and lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us."

Papa looked at her, but his face was tight and serious. He put a paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now." 

His paw pushed hers softly away.

She fled to the hallway. She sank to the floor and wrapped her arms around her knees, making herself as small as possible. 

*Are they mad at ME?* she thought.

The treasure-braid felt heavy and useless in her lap.

A moment later, she felt a heavy, warm paw on her back. It was Papa. He sat down close, his body a big, warm, safe presence, until her sharp sobs softened into quiet hiccups.

"I see you are very sad," he said softly. "Mama and I... we are arguing. But it is not your fault, little one, we love you." 

He squeezed her gently. "Mama and I need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" 

Liska nodded.

"Thank you," Papa said softly. "Where would be a cozy spot for you to wait?"

Liska stood, took his big paw, and led him to her sunny corner. She settled herself into the pillows, and Papa tucked them in around her before walking back into the house.

For a long moment, Liska just sat there, tracing the treasures on her braid with one paw. 

She placed the soft fur on top of the solid stone. Then she balanced her little clay mark on the very top. A tiny treasure-tower. 

Her ears perked up. It looked just like... their family paw pile! How they'd stack all their paws together and laugh. 

She looked from her own small paw to the treasure-braid. Then she looked toward the doorway, where her parents were. 

She snatched the braid up, scrambled to her paws, and marched back into the room.

She walked right between her parents, stood as tall as she could, and held up the braid. "LOOK!" she declared. "It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me! All together! Look!"

Her parents just stared. 

For a scary second, nothing happened.

Then, she took a tiny, shaky breath, and grabbed Papa's paw. She grunted and pulled him toward Mama with all her might. 

Then she grabbed Mama's paw. She joined their paws and placed her own little paw right on top.

"Paw pile," she commanded, her voice small but stubborn. "Us. Together."

Something in parents' eyes melted. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug.

"We're so sorry we worried you," Mama whispered into her fur.

They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss—all three noses touching in the middle. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

Later they sat in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring family sandwich.

She looked at their paws, all stacked in a pile.

"I made us remember," she said quietly, and a little purr rumbled in her throat.

Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most."

Later, from her sunny corner, Liska watched her parents talking softly.

"I'm sorry I was grumpy," said Papa.

"And I'm sorry I was cold," Mama's voice replied, soft again.

She saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. As he set it down, he touched Mama's shoulder, and Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes.

The next morning, Liska played in the garden. Her treasure-braid swung at her side. Stone, fur, clay. Her family. And her, brave enough to bring them all together.
