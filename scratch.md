One morning, Mama and Liska squeezed something enormous through the bedroom door. 

"Just... a... little... more!" Mama grunted, pushing the heavy pot.

Liska anchored her little feet, grabbed a giant leaf, and pulled with a mighty little "Hnngh!".

With a final push — SKWEEEAK! — in came their new monstera plant, its leaves full of holes, just like Swiss cheese.

"It's a friendly cheese monster! - Liska declared - I name it Mr. Cheesy!" Her pink nose poked through a leaf-hole like a tiny curious button.

That afternoon, Liska made the shadow her new playmate. "High-five!" she'd giggle, slapping her palm against a big leaf-shadow on the wall. A gust of wind through the open window made the leaf-shadow dance away, and she'd squeal, ready to chase it down for another high-five.

As night fell, Mama tucked Liska in tight as a cinnamon roll. A gust of wind made plant's shadow stretch and sway with the branches outside.

The friendly leaves grew longer... and longer... until they didn't look like leaves anymore. Now they looked like claws!

---

Liska's eyes widened. *It's just Mr. Cheesy.* She pulled the blanket over her head. "Go 'way," she whispered. "You're just a plant."

But under the blanket her imagination took over. What if the shadow crept across the floor? What if it touched her blanket? What if— 

Her heart started to beat very fast: BA-DUM, BA-DUM. BA-DUM, BA-DUM.

She threw the blanket off. The shadow's arms stretched long against the wall. It looked as if they were grasping... grasping for HER!

 Liska scrambled out of bed, flew down the hall, and crashed into her mother's legs. "MAMA!" she sobbed. "The shadow has CLAWS and it wants to GRAB ME!"

Mama scooped her up. "Oh, my sweet kitten, you're so scared."

She carried Liska back to the bedroom doorway and peeked inside.

"You're right," she whispered, looking at the wall. "That twisty shadow does look mighty fierce."

Mama carried her to the bed and sat on the edge, holding her close.

Liska nodded, leaving a wet patch of tears and maybe a little snot on Mama's nightgown. 

As Mama tucked her back in, her paws moved into the moonlight. 

A shadow butterfly appeared on the wall. It flew closer to the plant's shadow and began to circle a leafy claw. 

Liska watched, her eyes wide. The shadow butterfly was... beautiful? Not scary? 

"It's like they're dancing," she whispered. 

The next evening, Liska asked, "Ma-am, I'm still scared of the shadow. Can you help me?"

"Of course, kitten," her mother said softly. "First, let's notice. How does your body feel?"

"My heart is going thump-thump, thump-thump"

"I see," said her mother. "Then we need to help it calm down. Let's do a special breath. Smell a big flower... Liska took a slow *sniff* in... and now cool down the hot soup... and a long *whoooosh* out."

"Mama," Liska said, "remember the bird you did? I wanna do it too."

"Of course!" Mama made a bird with her paws and landed it on the wall. 

She pointed to the watering-can shadow. "Look, a grumpy elephant." she whispered, "I bet his trunk is ticklish. Do you think your shadow could sneak up and tickle it?"

Liska raised her finger. It flattened into a super-sneaky shadow-spy. He crept silently across the wall, hid for a second behind a crack, and then leaped out to bop the elephant right on the tip of its snoot!

Liska giggled. The grumpy elephant didn't seem so grumpy anymore.

---

The night came, and Mr. Cheesy's shadow again stretched across the wall. Liska's heart thumped nervously. But this time was different. Clutching her sloth until she worried his stuffing might pop, she took a slow *sniff* in and a long *whoooosh* out. 

Slowly, like a brave little snail, she stood up and crept toward the wall, lifting one shaky paw.

Her shadow appeared on the wall—small and wobbly, but THERE. Almost touching the plant's shadow. Her heart thumped wildly and her paw froze. 

"Come on, shadow paw," she whispered. "You're mine. Be brave. We're shadow dancers."

She stubbornly pushed her paw forward. Her shadow touched the plant shadow, and...

Nothing happened. No grabbing, no eating. Just her shadow-paw on the shadow-leaf.

"Oh!" Liska breathed. She wiggled her fingers, making the shadows dance together. 

"You're not scary," she said. "You're just... another shadow! You can't DO anything!" 

---

Then Liska noticed Slothy hiding under her arm. "Oh, you're scared too?" she whispered, hugging him. "It's okay. We just do the flower-soup breath. In... and out. Better, right?"

"Now LET'S FIGHT THAT SHADOW CHEESE MONSTER!"

She made Slothy's shadow climb up the monster's leafy claws. Higher and higher, until it reached the very top leaf.

There, it found a comfortable spot and gave a big, slow shadow-yawn.

The monster was gone. It became a bed in which a brave little hero slept peacefully. They won.

Mama, watching from the doorway, smiled. "I see we have brave new shadow dancers in here."

Liska watched the scene she had created with a small, proud smile on her face. 

Next night, when the shadows grew long again, Liska snuggled with Slothy. She was ready. "Come on, Mr. Cheesy," she whispered. "Let's dance."
