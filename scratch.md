One evening, something ENORMOUS tried to squeeze through Liska's bedroom door. The little snow leopard cub grabbed a giant leaf while Mama wrestled the rest. "Oof!" went Mama. "Poof!" went Liska. Finally—THUMP!—in came their new monstera plant, its leaves full of holes like swiss cheese and taller than Papa!

"It's a friendly cheese monster! I name it Mr. Cheesy!" Liska declared. Her pink nose poked through a leaf-hole like a curious button.

All day, Mr. Cheesy's shadow was a fun playmate. In the morning, it made dancing sun-fairies on the wall. At lunch, his shadow was a lumpy monster trying to eat her carrots. By evening, candlelight made the shadows bow and wiggle like fancy dancers with ants in their pants.

As night fell, Mama lifted Liska to wave goodnight to the moon, then tucked her in tight as a cinnamon roll with a special ear scratch and kiss. A gust of wind rattled the window, and the plant's shadow stretched and swayed with the branches outside.

The shadow changed. Those friendly leaf-hands became long, reaching fingers; the holes turned into watchful eyes. The shadow loomed like a multi-armed creeper itching to tickle her toes—or worse!

Liska's eyes widened like saucers. *It's just Mr. Cheesy, my friendly monster.* But in the moonlight, Mr. Cheesy looked HUNGRY. Her heart started to beat very fast: BA-DUM, BA-DUM. BA-DUM, BA-DUM. She pulled the blanket over her head. "Go 'way," she whispered. "You're just a plant."

But under the blanket was worse. What if the shadow crept across the floor? What if it touched her blanket? What if— She threw the blanket off. The shadow's arms stretched long, grasping at the walls, grasping... for HER! Liska scrambled out of bed, flew down the hall, and crashed into her mother's legs. "MAMA!" she sobbed. "The plant has ARMS and it wants to EAT ME!"

Mama scooped her up. "Oh, that twisty shadow does look mighty fierce," she murmured, rocking Liska on the soft cushions. Liska nodded, leaving a wet patch of tears and maybe a little snot on Mama's nightgown. 

They rocked until the sobs became hiccups. As Mama tucked her back in, her paw drifted into the moonlight, making a shadow butterfly that danced with the leaves. Liska watched, her eyes wide. The shadows were... silly? Not scary? Her mother sat beside her, gently scratching her back until Liska fell asleep.

The next evening, Liska asked, "Ma-am, I'm still scared of the shadow. Can you help me?"

"Of course, kitten," her mother said softly. "First, let's notice. How does your body feel?"

"My heart is going thump-thump-thump"

"I see," said her mother. "Then we need to help it calm down. Let's do our special breath. Smell a big flower... Liska took a slow *sniff* in... and now cool down the hot soup... and a long *whoooosh* out."

"Mama," Liska said, "remember the bird yesterday? I wanna do it too."

"Of course!" Mama made a bird with her paws and landed it on the wall. 

Mama pointed to the watering-can shadow. "Look, a grumpy elephant." she whispered, "I bet his trunk is ticklish. Do you think your shadow could sneak up and tickle it?"

Liska raised her finger. It flattened into a super-sneaky ninja shadow. It crept silently across the wall, hid for a second behind a crack, and then leaped out to bop the elephant right on the tip of its snoot!

That night, as Mr. Cheesy's shadow crept across the wall, Liska's heart thumped nervously. But this time was different. Clutching her sloth until she worried his stuffing might pop, she took a slow *sniff* in and a long *whoooosh* out. 

Slowly, like a brave little snail, she stood up and crept toward the wall, lifting one shaky paw.

Her shadow appeared on the wall—small and wobbly, but THERE. Almost touching the plant's shadow. Her heart thumped wildly and her paw froze. 

"Come on, shadow paw," she whispered. "You're mine. Be brave. We're shadow dancers."

She stubbornly pushed her paw forward. Her shadow touched the plant shadow, and...

Nothing happened. No grabbing, no eating. Just her shadow-paw on the shadow-leaf.

"Oh!" Liska breathed. She wiggled her fingers, making the shadows dance together. 

"You're not scary," she told the shadow. "You're just... another shadow! You can't DO anything!" 

Phew! She'd done it! She'd been scared but she'd stayed.

Liska noticed Slothy hiding under her arm. "Oh, you're scared too?" she whispered, hugging him. "First, we breathe."

"Smell the flower... cool the soup... *PHEW* Better, right? Now LET'S FIGHT THE SHADOW CHEESE MONSTER!"

She made Slothy's shadow climb up the monster's leafy claws. Higher and higher it climbed, until it reached the very top leaf.

There, it found a comfortable spot and gave a big, slow shadow-yawn.

The monster was gone. It became a bed in which a brave little hero slept peacefully. They won.

Mama, watching from the doorway, smiled. "I see we have a brave new shadow dancer in here."

Liska watched the scene she had created, a small, proud smile on her face. 

Next night, when the shadows grew long, Liska snuggled with Slothy. She was ready. "Come on, Mr. Cheesy," she whispered. "Let's dance."
