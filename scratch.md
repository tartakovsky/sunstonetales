The family house was bathed in early morning golden light streaming through the windows. The air was warm and cozy. In the back garden, there was a special sunny corner where the family often curled up together, creating a sense of safety and happiness.

Liska sat in the sunny corner, focused intently on finishing a small, thick belt. It was made of three braided strands. Woven into it were her greatest treasures: a small, rainbow 'courage stone' her father had given her. A tuft of her own white baby-fur that her mother had saved and tied with a silver thread. And a tiny, hardened clay tablet bearing her own first paw-print. Her very first mark on the world. "There," she whispered. "Now you're all safe together."

Her treasure-braid was finally done, tied snug around her waist. It felt like a warm hug. She bounced on her paws, a happy little wiggle starting in her tail. She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

Liska bounded into the main room and stopped. Papa stood by the window, tail stiff. Mama sat far away, face turned to the wall. Tension between them. This was unusual and unsettling for her.

Liska hesitated, then heard her father's voice, a low rumble, "I just don't understand why." Her mother's voice was a sharp whisper from across the room, "I can't talk about this now." The conflict was now undeniable.

Liska's ears drooped. Her happy wiggle died. She felt a little squeeze in her chest - confused and sad. But she shook her head and gripped her treasure-braid tighter. She could fix this!

Liska approached her father with her belt. Holding it up, she made a simple bid for connection: "Papa, look what I made." He glanced over, offered a distracted, "That's nice, sweetie," and turned away, his mind still on the argument. The failure to connect stung.

Unwilling to give up, Liska stepped right in front of Papa, lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling slightly. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us." Papa finally looked at her, but his eyes were still stormy. He put his paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now. Mama and I need a quiet moment." No reassurance, just the soft push away. Liska's heart crumbled.

Liska ran to the hallway and collapsed into the tiniest ball she could make. Her whole body shook with big, gulpy sobs that came from deep in her belly. She pressed her face into her paws, treasure-braid clutched tight against her chest. She wanted to disappear into the floor, to become invisible, to stop feeling this terrible hurt.

Her father, Daric, saw her curled into a tight, trembling ball in the hallway. The sight pierced his own upset. He walked over, sat on the floor beside her, and placed a heavy, warm paw on her back. He waited until her trembling subsided, then said softly, "Mama and I... we're feeling big, angry feelings. But our love for you, Liska, is always bigger than any angry. We love you very much." He gave her a gentle squeeze, then added, "We just need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" He then got up and returned to the main room.

Alone again, Liska clutched her braid tight. The stone felt solid like Papa. The fur felt soft like Mama. The clay felt warm like home. She thought about their family paw pile - how they'd stack all their paws together and laugh. Her tears stopped. Her eyes got bright with determination. She knew exactly what to do!

Liska marched back into the room, braid clutched in one paw. She planted herself between her parents and declared: "LOOK! It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me!"

Her parents just stared. The room went so quiet Liska could hear her own heartbeat thumping like tiny rabbit feet.

Before they could speak, Liska grabbed Mama's paw. Then Papa's paw. She pulled them together with all her might and placed her own small paw on top. "Paw pile," she commanded. She pressed down firmly, then let the pile spring back up. "Us. Together," she said, her voice small but stubborn.

Her parents looked at their paws, then at each other, and then down at her. Something melted in their eyes. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug, right in the middle. "We're sorry we worried you," her mother whispered into her fur.

A huge, happy sigh whooshed out of Liska. They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss - all three noses touching in the middle, making a perfect triangle of love. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

They sat together in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring parent sandwich. She looked down at their paws, still stacked together. "I made us remember," she said quietly, feeling proud. Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most."

Later, Liska was half-dozing in the sunny corner when she heard her parents talking softly. "I'm sorry I was so sharp," said Father. Mother's voice was warm. "And I'm sorry I went so quiet." Their tails twined together as they spoke.

The next morning, Liska saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. He touched her shoulder gently as he set it down. Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes. The air smelled like cinnamon and felt warm again. Liska bounced between them, her treasure-braid swinging. 

Liska touched each treasure on her braid - stone, fur, clay. Together was better. Always together.
