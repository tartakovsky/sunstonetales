**Arcane Ability:** Liska is developing a combination of her parents' abilities, able to create small arcane energy fields and beginning to learn how to soothe pain. She can temporarily suspend small objects in air, generate static charges, and produce a warming effect that eases minor discomfort. Her abilities often manifest unpredictably with her emotions, creating visible sparks of gold light around her paws that she's learning to move and control.
