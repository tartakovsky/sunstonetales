# Tahrra - Character Description

- **Appearance**: Small black panther with glossy fur and striking golden eyes; wears a distinctive orange-and-purple asymmetrical dress that she never changes
- **Personality**: Deeply introverted, observant, operates by her own internal logic
- **Special traits**:
    - Collects and organizes small shiny objects in precise patterns only she understands
    - Speaks rarely but when she does, offers surprisingly insightful observations
    - Counts her steps everywhere she goes in a whispered rhythm
    - Always sits in the exact same spot in any room she regularly visits
    - Can remain perfectly still for unusually long periods while observing something of interest
- **Behaviors**:
    - Carries a small notebook where she records "important things" (which might be the number of leaves on a plant or how many times someone blinks)
    - Hums the same three-note tune when concentrating
    - Has a special rock she rubs when feeling overwhelmed
    - Always arranges her food in specific patterns before eating
    - Prefers to communicate through drawings rather than words
- **Strengths**: Incredible memory for details, loyal friend (though in her own unique way), creative problem-solver with unconventional approaches

**Arcane Ability:** Tahrra can absorb and redirect light, creating areas of deeper shadow or complete darkness around her. She uses this ability to conceal herself, provide cooling shade for others, or temporarily blind opponents with sudden darkness. When using her ability intensely, her golden eyes gradually darken until they become completely black, making her nearly invisible in low light.
