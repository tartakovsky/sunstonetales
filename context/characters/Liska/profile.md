# Liska Kotichek
[RU] Лиска Котичек

## Family & Background
*   **Mother:** Mara Kotichek [RU] Мара Котичек (Provides emotional tools and co-regulation)
*   **Father:** Daric Kotichek [RU] Дарик Котичек (Provides practical tools and problem-solving frameworks)
*   **Origin:** A young snow leopard from the snowy region of Sar-Gora, now navigating her new coastal home in Sarabad. This move provides a backdrop for her social caution in new situations.

## Physical Appearance
*   White fur with silver-gray spots and warm, expressive brown eyes.
*   One ear is slightly taller than the other.
*   **Vulnerability Tell:** When overwhelmed, tired, or trying to calm down, she has a quiet habit of sucking on the tip of her tail for comfort.

## Archetype & Narrative Role
*   **Archetype:** The Curious Protagonist.
*   **Core Function:** She is **The Heart** of the stories. Liska's internal world is the central focus. She drives the narrative by experiencing relatable childhood social conflicts and learning, within the confines of each story, how to navigate them. Her struggles are reset with each new book, providing a stable, familiar starting point for the reader.

## Core Personality & Nuances
*   **Strong Sense of Self and Personal Boundaries:** Liska has a very clear idea of her own space and needs. She becomes visibly upset and may pull away sharply if others (even friends) try to hug or touch her without invitation. Her tail will puff up as a warning when her boundaries are crossed.
*   **Struggles with Conversational Turn-Taking:** She feels unheard when others talk for too long. Her frustration builds until she might interrupt, turn away, or demand, "Stop talking now!" because she feels her own need to speak is being ignored.
*   **A "Tryer" with Emotional Regulation:** Liska feels things intensely. When overwhelmed by frustration or anger, she has a physical need to release it. She actively uses concrete strategies taught by her parents to manage these feelings, showing that regulation is a skill she is practicing.
*   **Prone to Negativity Bias:** She feels setbacks and social slights very deeply. A single negative event can overshadow an entire day's worth of fun. A recurring challenge for her is learning the conscious effort required to recall and value positive moments.
*   **Deep Sense of Responsibility:** When she understands that her actions have caused a problem, she feels a powerful and genuine sense of guilt. This motivates her to try and make things right, demonstrating her underlying good heart despite her social difficulties.
*   **Impulsive Actions Driven by Desire:** Her impulsivity is tied to immediate wants (the tasty cheburek, a shiny object). She struggles with delayed gratification, a challenge that requires external tools (like the piggy bank) to manage, rather than pure willpower.
