# Liska Kotichek
[RU] Лиска Котичек

## Family & Background
*   **Mother:** Mara Kotichek [RU] Мара Котичек (Provides emotional tools and co-regulation)
*   **Father:** Daric Kotichek [RU] Дарик Котичек (Provides practical tools and problem-solving frameworks)
*   **Origin:** A young snow leopard from the snowy region of Sar-Gora, now navigating her new coastal home in Sarabad. This move provides a backdrop for her social caution in new situations.

## Physical Appearance
*   White fur with silver-gray spots and warm, expressive brown eyes.
*   One ear is slightly taller than the other.
*   **Vulnerability Tell:** When overwhelmed, tired, or trying to calm down, she has a quiet habit of sucking on the tip of her tail for comfort.

## Archetype & Narrative Role
*   **Archetype:** The Curious Protagonist.
*   **Core Function:** She is **The Heart** of the stories. Liska's internal world is the central focus. She drives the narrative by experiencing relatable childhood social conflicts and learning, within the confines of each story, how to navigate them. Her struggles are reset with each new book, providing a stable, familiar starting point for the reader.

## Core Personality & Nuances
*   **Strong Sense of Self and Personal Boundaries:** Liska has a very clear idea of her own space and needs. She becomes visibly upset and may pull away sharply if others (even friends) try to hug or touch her without invitation. Her tail will puff up as a warning when her boundaries are crossed.
*   **Struggles with Conversational Turn-Taking:** She feels unheard when others talk for too long. Her frustration builds until she might interrupt, turn away, or demand, "Stop talking now!" because she feels her own need to speak is being ignored.
*   **A "Tryer" with Emotional Regulation:** Liska feels things intensely. When overwhelmed by frustration or anger, she has a physical need to release it, often by finding a large leaf and tearing it to shreds. She actively uses concrete strategies taught by her parents (like counting) to manage these feelings, showing that regulation is a skill she is practicing.
*   **Prone to Negativity Bias:** She feels setbacks and social slights very deeply. A single negative event can overshadow an entire day's worth of fun. A recurring challenge for her is learning the conscious effort required to recall and value positive moments.
*   **Deep Sense of Responsibility:** When she understands that her actions have caused a problem, she feels a powerful and genuine sense of guilt. This motivates her to try and make things right, demonstrating her underlying good heart despite her social difficulties.
*   **Impulsive Actions Driven by Desire:** Her impulsivity is tied to immediate wants (the tasty cheburek, a shiny object). She struggles with delayed gratification, a challenge that requires external tools (like the piggy bank) to manage, rather than pure willpower.

## Arcane Ability: Emotional Sparks
Liska's arcane ability is a direct, uncontrollable manifestation of her inner emotional state, making her internal world visible. Her paws glow and release colored sparks that reflect her feelings.

*   **Function:** The sparks are an undeniable truth-teller. She cannot hide her anger or disappointment, forcing her and others to acknowledge her feelings directly. This often precipitates the story's central conflict or the moment of co-regulation with a parent.
*   **Colors:** The sparks match the Mood Flower colors—golden for joy, red for anger, blue for sadness.
*   **Growth (within a story):** As she works through a problem and achieves emotional balance, she can gain temporary, purposeful control over her powers, such as creating a soothing warmth to heal or controlling her sparkles. Her magic grows as her emotional understanding grows for that moment. 


## Liska's Humor Profile

**1. Adorable Effort**
*   **Description:** The comedy of her putting 100% serious effort into a task, with comically cute results.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She tries to draw a straight line. Her tongue sticks out, her tail twitches, and the line comes out... like a happy little worm.
    *   The Puffed Cheeks: When trying to be brave or stand up for herself after her boundaries are crossed, she might puff out her cheeks for a mighty roar, only to produce a tiny, frustrated squeak.
    *   She tries to lift a giant apple. GRUNT! WOBBLE! She looks like a little white beetle trying to roll the sun.

**2. Awkward Grace**
*   **Description:** The funny gap between her serious attempts at elegance and her body's wobbly, uncooperative reality.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She announced, "I am a graceful leaf in the wind!" She spun once, twice, and then... THUMP. She was a graceful snowball on the floor.
    *   She tried to pour juice with her pinky out, just like Mama. The juice poured perfectly... right into her own lap.
    *   She tried to give a very serious bow. Her head was too heavy, and she tipped over, showing everyone her fluffy white tail.

**3. Fierce Ownership**
*   **Description:** Her need for control over her space and belongings, expressed with charmingly serious declarations.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She held up a stick. "This is my official Pointing Stick. Only I can point with it."
    *   She arranged three bottle caps. "This is my royal treasure," she whispered. "The red one is dragon's gold."
    *   She holds up a particularly pretty leaf she plans to tear later. "This is my angry leaf," she might explain with total seriousness. "It is waiting for an emergency."

**4. Serious Formality**
*   **Description:** Her attempt to manage the chaos of play by imposing hilariously rigid, grown-up rules and manners.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She hosts a tea party, asking her toy, "Mr. Bear, would you care for another pretend biscuit? Please use your napkin."
    *   A butterfly lands on her paw. She looks at it gravely and says, "A pleasure to make your acquaintance."
    *   When playing with Tahrra, she might declare, "First, we will build the tower. Then, we will have a meeting to decide its color. Please prepare your ideas."

**5. Naive Logic**
*   **Description:** Her flawless but incorrect reasoning that makes perfect sense from her limited, self-contained perspective.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She puts a bandage on a drooping flower's stem to "make it feel better."
    *   Why is your shadow so long in the evening? "Because it is tired," she explained. "It wants to lie down."
    *   She saw her reflection in a puddle and whispered, "Look! A water-me. I must be very quiet so I don't scare her away."

**6. Literal Misunderstanding**
*   **Description:** Her concrete thinking as she navigates a new world of confusing idioms and figures of speech.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Mama says, "Hold your horses." Liska looks around, confused. "But... where are the horses?"
    *   Papa says he has "butterflies in his stomach." Liska pats his tummy gently. "Don't worry," she whispers. "I'll help you let them out."
    *   Her mother says, "We'll have to play it by ear." Liska looks at her own ears, confused, wondering how they will help her play.
    *   Her father says a project will "cost an arm and a leg." Liska looks down at her own paws with alarm, worried she might have to give one up.
