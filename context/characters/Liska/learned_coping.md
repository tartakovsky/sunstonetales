# Liska's Learned Coping Behaviors for Anger

This document lists the specific coping strategies that Liska has been taught by her parents to manage anger, ensuring consistency in her emotional regulation journey. These behaviors are designed to be developmentally appropriate for a 4-6-year-old, providing safe, actionable ways to release and manage anger as per the project's psychological guidelines.

## 1. Stomping and Growling
- **Description**: Liska is taught to stomp her feet and growl to release the physical and vocal tension of anger. This dual action helps her express the energy of her 'Little Volcano' in a safe, controlled way.
- **How Taught**: Parents model this by stomping and growling playfully with her, often in outdoor or safe spaces like on sand or grass, framing it as 'letting out the heat.'
- **Narrative Example**: 
  > Мама сказала: – Если Вулканчик жжёт, потопай и порычи! – Лиска топнула лапками по песку и рыкнула, будто выгоняя жар.
  > (Mom said: – If the Little Volcano burns, stomp and growl! – Liska stomped her paws on the sand and growled, as if driving out the heat.)

## 2. Deep Breathing
- **Description**: Liska is taught to take slow, deep breaths to calm her body and mind after the initial burst of anger. This helps reduce the intensity of her 'Little Volcano' by slowing her heart rate.
- **How Taught**: Parents guide her by breathing deeply together, often placing a paw on her chest to feel the rise and fall, framing it as 'cooling the heat inside.'
- **Narrative Example**: 
  > Папа показал: – Дыши глубоко, вот так. Это охлаждает Вулканчик. – Лиска вдохнула медленно и почувствовала, как жар утихает.
  > (Dad showed: – Breathe deeply, like this. It cools the Little Volcano. – Liska inhaled slowly and felt the heat subside.)

## 3. Pushing Paws Against Each Other, Growling, and Relaxing
- **Description**: Liska is taught to push her paws together hard while growling to release tension, then relax her body to let go of the remaining anger. This combines physical effort, vocal expression, and a calming release.
- **How Taught**: Parents demonstrate by pressing their own paws or hands together, growling briefly, then relaxing with a big sigh, framing it as 'squeezing out the heat, then resting.'
- **Narrative Example**: 
  > Мама объяснила: – Сожми лапки сильно и порычи, а потом отпусти. – Лиска сжала лапки, рыкнула и расслабилась, чувствуя, как Вулканчик стихает.
  > (Mom explained: – Squeeze your paws hard and growl, then let go. – Liska squeezed her paws, growled, and relaxed, feeling the Little Volcano quiet down.)

## 4. Disappointment (Transitional Event)
- **Note**: Disappointment is a brief transitional event leading to Sadness, Anger, or Helplessness. There are no specific learned coping behaviors defined for Disappointment itself. The learned coping response is governed by the resulting emotional state (Sadness, Anger, or Helplessness) as defined in their respective sections or future updates to this document.

## 5. Temptation
- **Self-Talk Phrase**: She repeats a simple phrase taught by her parents, like "Wait, think, ask," to slow down her impulse and consider consequences.
  - **Narrative Example**: 
    > Мама научила её маленькой хитрости: «Если что-то очень хочется, скажи себе тихонько: подожди, подумай, спроси». И Лиска прошептала эти слова, чтобы её лапки не тянулись к игрушке сами.
    > (Mom taught her a little trick: "If you want something very much, tell yourself quietly: wait, think, ask." And Liska whispered these words so her paws wouldn't reach for the toy by themselves.)
- **Counting to Take a Break**: She has learned to count to five slowly to break the fixation and redirect her energy, a strategy taught as a way to "pause the want."
  - **Narrative Example**: 
    > «Попробуй сосчитать до пяти, — предложил папа, — это помогает, когда лапки тянутся сами». Лиска послушно начала считать: «Один... два... три...» — и правда, ей стало легче устоять.
    > ("Try counting to five," suggested Dad, "it helps when your paws reach out on their own." Liska obediently started counting: "One... two... three..." — and indeed, it became easier for her to resist.)
- **Deep Breathing to Take a Break**: She has learned to take deep breaths to break the fixation and calm her body, another way to "pause the want."
  - **Narrative Example**: 
    > «А ещё можно сделать глубокий вдох, — посоветовала мама, — будто ты выдыхаешь само желание». Лиска глубоко вдохнула и медленно выдохнула. Сразу стало легче, будто невидимый магнит её отпустил.
    > ("You can also take a deep breath," advised Mom, "as if you're breathing out the want itself." Liska took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. It immediately became easier, as if an invisible magnet let her go.)
