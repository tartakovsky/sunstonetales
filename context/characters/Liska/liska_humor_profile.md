## Liska's Humor Profile

**1. Adorable Effort**
*   **Description:** The comedy of her putting 100% serious effort into a task, with comically cute results.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She tries to draw a straight line. Her tongue sticks out, her tail twitches, and the line comes out... like a happy little worm.
    *   The Puffed Cheeks: When trying to be brave or stand up for herself after her boundaries are crossed, she might puff out her cheeks for a mighty roar, only to produce a tiny, frustrated squeak.
    *   She tries to lift a giant apple. GRUNT! WOBBLE! She looks like a little white beetle trying to roll the sun.

**2. Awkward Grace**
*   **Description:** The funny gap between her serious attempts at elegance and her body's wobbly, uncooperative reality.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She announced, "I am a graceful leaf in the wind!" She spun once, twice, and then... THUMP. She was a graceful snowball on the floor.
    *   She tried to pour juice with her pinky out, just like Mama. The juice poured perfectly... right into her own lap.
    *   She tried to give a very serious bow. Her head was too heavy, and she tipped over, showing everyone her fluffy white tail.

**3. Fierce Ownership**
*   **Description:** Her need for control over her space and belongings, expressed with charmingly serious declarations.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She held up a stick. "This is my official Pointing Stick. Only I can point with it."
    *   She arranged three bottle caps. "This is my royal treasure," she whispered. "The red one is dragon's gold."
    *   She holds up a particularly pretty leaf she plans to tear later. "This is my angry leaf," she might explain with total seriousness. "It is waiting for an emergency."

**5. Naive Logic**
*   **Description:** Her flawless but incorrect reasoning that makes perfect sense from her limited, self-contained perspective.
*   **Examples:**
    *   She puts a bandage on a drooping flower's stem to "make it feel better."
    *   Why is your shadow so long in the evening? "Because it is tired," she explained. "It wants to lie down."
    *   She saw her reflection in a puddle and whispered, "Look! A water-me. I must be very quiet so I don't scare her away."

**6. Literal Misunderstanding**
*   **Description:** Her concrete thinking as she navigates a new world of confusing idioms and figures of speech.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Mama says, "Hold your horses." Liska looks around, confused. "But... where are the horses?"
    *   Papa says he has "butterflies in his stomach." Liska pats his tummy gently. "Don't worry," she whispers. "I'll help you let them out."
    *   Her mother says, "We'll have to play it by ear." Liska looks at her own ears, confused, wondering how they will help her play.
    *   Her father says a project will "cost an arm and a leg." Liska looks down at her own paws with alarm, worried she might have to give one up.
