# Anji Pawson
[RU] Анжи

Anji is Siamese-Bengal crossbreed

Siamese part:

**The ultimate champion of annoying traits:**

- Extremely vocal with a distinctive, loud "yowl" that can't be ignored
- Never stops "talking" and will interrupt conversations with their opinions
- Highly demanding of attention - will literally paw at your face if ignored
- Intelligent enough to know exactly how to get what they want
- Known for following their people EVERYWHERE (even the bathroom)

Bengal part:

**The hyperactive troublemaker:**

- Energetic, bouncy, never seems to stop moving
- Gets into EVERYTHING - no cabinet is safe
- Often described as "part cat, part monkey, part toddler"
- Will randomly sprint around at full speed for no apparent reason
- Known to splash in water, knocking things over constantly
- Can learn to open doors, drawers, and even simple locks
- Takes things without permission, not from meanness but impulsivity
- Doesn't understand personal space or quiet time

# **Appearance**

Cream-colored fur with striking dark brown points on his face, ears, paws, and tail; intense bright blue eyes that seem too wide; sleek, always-in-motion body with Bengal-like golden spots scattered across his shoulders and back; whiskers that twitch constantly with excitement

Short dark cape, on his neck reaching to mid back, no vest, just the cape.

**Arcane Ability:** Anji possesses an unusually strong connection to arcane energy but lacks any natural control mechanism. His body constantly absorbs and randomly releases this energy, causing unpredictable disturbances in the physical forces around him—objects suddenly change weight, static electricity builds and discharges, light bends oddly, or sounds distort. When his arcane energy spikes, his cream fur develops a subtle prismatic sheen, his spots briefly glow with purple light, and the air around him seems to ripple with faint purple distortions. These manifestations intensify with his emotional state, creating a chaotic aura that makes the impossible momentarily possible in his vicinity. Unlike others who channel arcane energy purposefully, Anji's challenge is containing the wild purple energy that naturally flows through him.
