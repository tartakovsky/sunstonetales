Doesn’t speak local language. Makes mistakes, only speaks trivial phrases

**Language quirks:**

- "Me help!" (Instead of "I'll help")
- "This good!" (For approval)
- "No understand" (When confused)
- "Friends together?" (Asking to play)
- "Lucia home far" (Explaining she's from elsewhere)
- Mixes up pronouns: "Him sad" instead of "She's sad"
- Uses present tense for everything: "Yesterday I go to sea"
- Adds Latin-inspired endings: "Friendus maximus!"

**Arcane Ability:** Lucia can temporarily enhance her physical capabilities beyond normal limits—jumping higher, running faster, and exhibiting surprising strength for her size. This makes her naturally bold and adventurous, willing to attempt physical feats others would avoid. When activating her abilities, her skin emits a subtle red-orange glow that intensifies with her exertion.
