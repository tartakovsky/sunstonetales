# Anji Pawson's Arcane Abilities

## Arcane Ability: Uncontrolled Energy
Anji's body is a chaotic battery for raw arcane energy. He doesn't use his power; his power *happens* to him and the world around him, especially when he's excited or emotional. This is the in-world source of his physical comedy.

**Narratively Useful Manifestations:**

- **The Betrayal of Objects:** Everyday items actively rebel against his intentions in funny ways.
  - **Example:** He reaches for a cookie. A purple spark jumps from his paw to the cookie, which then leaps into the air, does a flip, and lands just out of his reach.
  - **Example:** He tries to sit on a stool. His static charge makes the stool scoot away just as he sits. *THUMP*. He lands on the floor, looking at the stool with utter betrayal.
- **The Unhelpful Float:** Objects he interacts with can suddenly lose their weight, creating silly problems instead of solving them.
  - **Example:** He tries to hand Liska a pretty rock. *Fzzt!* The rock glows purple and floats gently out of his paws, hovering in the air like a confused balloon.
  - **Example:** He trips. The apple he was carrying becomes weightless and hangs in the air for a moment before dropping right on his head.
- **The Sticky Situation:** His static energy makes things cling to him in comical ways.
  - **Example:** He runs through a pile of dry leaves. A purple glow envelops him, and the leaves don't just scatter—they stick all over his fur until he looks like a walking, giggling leaf-monster.
  - **Example:** After sliding on a rug, every small, light object in the room is gently pulled towards him. Feathers, flower petals, and dust bunnies form a small, orbiting cloud around him.
- **The Bouncy Effect:** His energy can change an object's properties, turning a normal impact into a slapstick bounce.
  - **Example:** He drops a stone. Instead of a *thud*, it hits the ground with a purple flash and bounces back up like a super-ball, bopping him gently on the nose.
- **The Sensory Glitch:** His emotional state can briefly warp light and sound around him.
  - **Example:** He gets very excited and looks at a friend. The air around him shimmers purple, making his friend's head look comically tiny and their paws look huge for a second, like looking through a funhouse mirror.
