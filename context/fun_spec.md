# Liska Project: Fun & Humor Generation Specification

## 1. Core Principles

The primary goal is to generate narratives that are emotionally resonant and genuinely funny for both children and adults. Stories must be compelling simulations of a child's inner world, not lectures with fur. All humor and plot developments must emerge organically from the established character profiles and the constraints of the story world.

## 2. World & Reality Constraints

-   **No Magic:** The narrative universe operates on plausible, real-world physics. There are no arcane abilities, magical spells, or supernatural occurrences.
-   **No Anthropomorphism of Inanimate Objects:** The laws of physics are not broken. Clouds do not wink, doors do not have hiccups, and furniture does not have feelings. Animals may have human-like thoughts and emotions, but objects remain inanimate.
-   **Setting:** The default setting is a plausible, low-fantasy, late-medieval world. Technology, social structures, and daily life should be consistent with this era.

## 3. Target Emotional & Comedic Impact

The content must elicit specific, strong reactions from its dual audience.

### 3.1 For Adults:
-   **Chuckle:** Witty observations, relatable parenting moments (`Dual-Layer Humor`), and the charmingly flawed logic of a child.
-   **"Aww":** Moments of extreme cuteness, `Adorable Effort`, vulnerability, and genuine connection between characters.
-   **Touched (Tears Welling Up):** Profound moments of empathy, parental love, a child's genuine remorse, or the successful navigation of a difficult emotion that leads to connection.

### 3.2 For Children:
-   **Laugh Out Loud (LOL):** Physical comedy (`Slapstick`), large-scale harmless messes (`The Big Mess`), and unexpected, disproportionate reactions (`Dramatic Overreaction`).
-   **"Aww":** Similar to adults, stemming from moments of `Adorable Effort` and cute vulnerability.

## 4. Humor Generation Engine

Humor must be character-driven, intentional, and executed with brevity.

### 4.1 Primary Humor Source
-   The full library of humor archetypes defined in `context/fun_types.md` is approved for use. Humor should be selected based on the character performing the action to ensure consistency (e.g., Liska's humor is more internal and based on `Adorable Effort` and `Naive Logic`; Anji's is external and based on `Physical Comedy` and `The Runaway Action`).

### 4.2 Core Comedic Techniques
-   **Childish Logic:** The character's actions must make perfect sense from their limited, flawed perspective. The humor arises from the gap between their "flawless" logic and the reality of the outcome.
-   **Rationalizing the Ridiculous:** A key source of humor is a character performing a ridiculous action and then immediately justifying it with a simple, confident statement, as if it were the most logical thing in the world.
    -   *Example:* After getting a dot of paint on her nose, Liska doesn't see it as a mistake. She examines it and declares, "A good dot." This reframes a failure as an accomplishment.

## 5. Linguistic Style: Child-Like Neologisms

The use of charming, child-like constructed words is highly encouraged to enhance the sense of wonder and create a unique story-world dialect.

### Directive: Generate and Use Child-Like Words
A library of these words should be developed and used where appropriate. They add texture and humor.

**Construction Formulas:**
1.  **The "Un-" Prefix:** Apply "un-" to verbs that are not typically reversible to signify a desire to undo an action.
    -   *Examples:* "un-stomp," "un-klonk," "un-spill," "un-smudge."
2.  **The "-y" Suffix:** Add "-y" to nouns or onomatopoeic sounds to create descriptive, feeling-based adjectives.
    -   *Examples:* "ouchy," "buzzy," "thumpy," "klonky," "splishy."
3.  **Onomatopoeia-as-Verb:** Use sound-effect words directly as verbs for actions.
    -   *Examples:* "The stool *klonked* on the floor." "He *thumped* down the path." "The paint *splatted* everywhere."
4.  **Functional Descriptions:** Describe objects by what they do, especially when the proper name is unknown or too complex.
    -   *Examples:* "the seeing-circles" (glasses), "the pointy-thing" (fork), "the warm-maker" (fireplace).
