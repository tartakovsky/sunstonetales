# Emotion Unfolding Sequence
## Anger

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska’s paws clenched into tight fists. A low "Grrrr!" rumbled in her chest.

2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   A hot, prickly feeling spread through her tummy. Her face felt tight and warm.

3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    <!-- Here we need to be very careful. We need to show simultaneously REAL reaction that a child can recognize and psychologically DESIRABLE reaction that the child will copy. Hitting someone in anger is real, but not desirable. Breathing out and calming down immediately is desirable, but not real. -->
    *   She turned her back on everyone and hid her face in her paws.

4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She remembered her tool and did three Strong Stomps on the ground.

## Sadness

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska's shoulders drooped. A long, quiet sigh puffed out of her lips.

2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   Her whole body felt heavy. There was a hollow, empty space in her chest.

3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   She quietly wrapped her tail around her body, giving herself a soft hug.

4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She walked over to her mother and used her words: "Can I tell you about my feeling?"

## Fear

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska froze completely still. Her eyes grew wide and her ears went flat.

2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   Her tummy felt like it was full of fizzy butterflies. A shiver ran down her back.

3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   She made herself small and ducked behind her father’s leg, peeking out.

4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She looked at her own paw and slowly touched each finger, counting to five.

## Disappointment

0.  **The Preceding Hope (Anticipation):**
    *   Liska's body was buzzing with excitement. Her eyes were bright and she was leaning forward, imagining the fun she was about to have.

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Her bright, expectant face melted and slackened. Her body froze for a moment, processing the shock of the loss.

2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   A sudden, sickening lurch hit her stomach. A heavy, empty thud filled her chest, as if a stone had just dropped.

3.  **Transition to Emotional Pathway:**
    *   This moment of disappointment, captured by the 'Dropping Stone (Упавший Камень)' metaphor, is a brief transitional event. It immediately leads to one of three emotional states: Sadness, Anger, or Helplessness. All subsequent body language, internal feelings, and coping strategies (both instinctive and learned) are governed by the resulting emotion as defined in project documents.

4.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   Take from the resulting emotion

5.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   Take from the resulting emotion

## Temptation

0.  **The Initial Attraction (Anticipation of Reward):**
    *   Liska's body buzzed with excitement. Her eyes locked onto the object of desire, imagining the immediate reward.

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Her body leaned slightly toward the object, as if drawn by an invisible force. Her paws twitched and reached slightly, then pulled back. Her eyes fixated intensely, and her breathing became quick and shallow. Her tail tip flicked rapidly with restless energy.

2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   A strong, invisible tug pulled at her chest and hands, urging her toward the object. A restless, tingling excitement filled her body, narrowing her focus to the temptation. A warm, itchy feeling of wanting grew stronger with each moment she resisted.

3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   She took a small step closer to the object, drawn by the pull, before catching herself. Her paw hovered near it, trembling with the urge, or she turned her head away briefly, though her eyes kept darting back.

4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She repeated a simple self-talk phrase like "Wait, think, ask," to slow her impulse, or counted to five slowly, or took deep breaths to break the fixation and pause the want, as taught by her parents.
