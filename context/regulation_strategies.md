# Regulation Strategies

## **Parent-Child Co-Regulation Options**

1. **Child:** Behaves according to the selected trigger.
2. **Parent**
    - IF child's behavior crosses boundaries OR has immediate safety risk:
        - Ensures safety (Physically prevent harm; remove object/child)
        - Calmly states the boundary (Clear, firm, short: "No hitting.")
    - `Support`: `Calm Presence`
    - `Support`: `Intentional Connection` (Eye level; soft voice; gentle touch if okay)
    - `Support`: `Physical Contact` (let me give you a hug, if okay)
    - `Support`:  `Acknowledge Emotions` (I see you’re feeling angry)
    - `Support`: `Validate Emotions` (It's okay to feel that: "It's okay to be mad.")
3. **Child:** De-escalates somewhat
4. **Parent:**
    - Slot: Parent asks if child wants to use a known `Coping Strategy` together
    - `Support`: `Active Listening`. Listens actively if the child wants to talk (Nod; "Mm-hmm"; repeat back what child says)
    - At this point regulation is typically done. The next step, if appropriate, is moving on to solution building or just returning to normal activities

## **Peer Interaction Options (Children C1, C2, C3)**

**C1:** Behaves according to the selected `Emotional Trigger`

- Slot: `Coping Strategy` (Optional, C1 tries self-regulation first)

### **C2 tries to help**

- Slot: `Support` type that C2 offers (child version: "Are you okay?" "Do you want to play?" "I can help!")
- C1 gets better
    - C1 calms; positive peer interaction successful (Show: Helping works; accepting help is good)
- C1 stays dysregulated
    - Helper's attempt doesn't immediately work; situation may persist or shift. C2 might try again, withdraw, or seek adult help (Show: Trying to help is good, even if not instant; persistence or getting help)
    - Slot: `Dysregulation` potentially for C2
    - Slot: `Coping Strategy` for C2 if hurt by failed attempt
    - Slot: `Support` or `Coping Strategy` C2 might try again, typically some other simple support strategy, or getting help from adults
- C1 escalates
    - C1's distress increases despite C2's help; C2 may withdraw or get overwhelmed (Show: Sometimes help isn't received; helper can step back)
    - Slot: `Coping Strategy` (C2 self-protects: steps back, finds adult)

### **C2 escalates**

- C1 escalates: Both children dysregulated
    - **Adult Intervention Required**
    - Slot: `Adult ensures safety` (Separates children if needed).
    - Slot: `Adult applies Parent-Child Co-Regulation Sequence` for both children (either one after the other, or as a group)
    - Slot: `Post-Regulation Support` (e.g., `Gentle Guidance Questions` to help them talk it out).
    - **Story Message**: Aggression leads to more problems; adults help everyone calm down.
- C1 escapes
    - Slot: `Coping Strategy`
    - C1 removes self from conflict; problem unresolved but immediate escalation avoided (Show: Walking away is a valid choice)
- C3 interferes
    - Slot: `Support` (C3 offers peer mediation: "Stop!" "Let's all calm down!")
    - C3 attempts to mediate or stop escalation; outcome varies (Show: Friends can help stop fights; helpful bystander)

### **C2 ignores**

- C1 escalates
    - Slot: `Coping Strategy` (C1 might try getting attention differently)
    - C1's distress/behavior intensifies to get attention or due to feeling unheard (Show: Being ignored feels bad; can worsen things)
- C1 escapes
    - Slot: `Coping Strategy` (C1 self-soothes or seeks other help)
    - C1 withdraws, feeling unheard/rejected; may try to self-soothe or problem remains (Show: It's okay to step away if ignored; self-care)
- C3 helps
    - Slot: `Support` (C3 offers what C2 didn't: "I see you're sad," comfort)
    - C3 steps in to support C1 when C2 ignores; positive bystander action (Show: Noticing and helping someone ignored is kind)

## **Child Alone Self-Regulation Options**

- **Child:** Behaves according to the selected trigger (e.g., cries, freezes, stomps).
- **IF fully unable to regulate, a natural transition occurs:**
    - **Path A: Natural Consequence.** The child's action leads to an immediate, tangible outcome that shifts their emotional state (e.g., a thrown toy breaks, leading to surprise and sadness).
    - **Path B: Emotional Peak Passes.** The child's energy is spent, and the intense emotion subsides naturally over a short time (e.g., big sobs turn into quiet sniffles).
- **Child: Attempts a learned coping strategy.**
    - **Slot: `Coping Strategy`**. The child recalls and actively uses a specific skill from the list.
        - Examples: `My Special Comfort Item` (hugging a bear), `Simple Self-Talk` ("I can do this"), `Cooling Breaths`, `Strong Stomps`.
- **Outcome of Coping Attempt:**
    - **IF strategy is effective:**
        - The child feels noticeably calmer and is now able to think or act more clearly.
        - **Story Message:** I can use my tools to help myself feel better.
    - **ELSE strategy is partially effective OR needs repetition:**
        - The child shows persistence. The calming effect is minimal but allows for a small next step.
        - **Optional Slot: `Second Coping Strategy Attempt`**. The child either repeats the first strategy or tries a different one. (e.g., After `Strong Stomps`, they try `Belly Buddy Breathing`).
        - **Story Message:** It's okay if it doesn't work perfectly the first time. Trying is what helps.
