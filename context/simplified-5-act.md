## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere

Start with a classic storytelling opening (e.g., "One morning," "That day..."). Introduce the main character(s) in their world through endearing and engaging actions that show their personality. Weave in 1-2 vivid sensory details (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) to establish atmosphere. The narrative can focus first on the character or the setting. Strictly "show, don't tell."

**Psychology:** No developmental rules apply. Pure world-building and character introduction. Establish personality and agency through action, creating immediate sensory engagement without emotional labels.

**Engagement:** Evoke an immediate "aww," "ooh," "wow," or laugh through character appeal and setting. The character's actions must be endearing and reveal their personality. Sensory details should present a fresh, wondrous world from a child's perspective to draw readers in.

**Length:** 3-6 lines maximum

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up

Set the stage for the core challenge through character actions, environmental setup, or a familiar routine that builds anticipation and leads naturally to the main incident.

**Psychology:** No developmental rules apply. Pure character/plot setup. Character acts with agency, true to their nature.

**Engagement:** Build high anticipation. Show the character completely absorbed in an activity or use the environment to draw the reader in.

**Length:** 2-3 lines

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

The direct trigger (cause, not effect) of the core problem. Can be an external accident, internal choice (impulsiveness), or innocent behavior (comforting habit) believable for the character.

**Psychology:** The trigger is an agentic action from the character's established nature or location, even if accidental.

**Engagement:** The pivot point. The event must feel surprising yet inevitable, creating an "uh oh" sense of anticipation. Tone can be high-energy, comedic, or foreboding.
<!-- That is not exactly true, or rather not complete. What you said is good, but for example in one of the Falling Asleep stories the catalyst was a very calm and soothing habit of a character sucking her own tail. So there was nothing high-energy comedic or foreboding, it was a cute and warm scene, demonstrating their desirable habit in a normalized way. -->

**Length:** 2-4 lines

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident

The direct consequence of the catalyst; the problem is now tangible. Show its immediate physical or emotional impact to make the stakes clear.

**Psychology:**
- Show physical manifestation, then provide one brief emotion label.
- The emotional response must be authentic and agentic.

**Engagement:** A critical beat to engage readers with the character's plight. Use dramatic reactions, vivid descriptions, or a relatable predicament to evoke empathy. The tone can be humorous but must not diminish the character's stakes.

**Length:** 3-6 lines

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)

The child's first impulsive and flawed attempts to solve the problem. They are logical from the child's perspective but fail. A second attempt may follow and show learning, but also ends in failure.

**Psychology:**
- The attempt must be driven by the child (agency), not adults.
- Support should be minimal (e.g., offering a tool, asking guiding questions) and only if necessary, e.g. to redirect from adult dependency.

**Engagement:** Action-focused, building momentum. Attempts must reflect a child's unique logic and limited experience, creating tension, showing determination, or hinting at success.

**Length:** 4-10 lines

### Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)

The character hits an emotional and practical low point, confronting their limitations. This can be a full breakdown, vivid despair ("furry noodle"), or a behavioral relapse. Show strong physical manifestation, the practical failure, and provide one key emotion label.

**Psychology:**
- The character confronts the natural consequences of their failed attempts.
- Show dysregulation of plot-approptiate intensity (with parent/peers or alone).
- The breakdown or relapse must be authentic.

**Engagement:** High emotional intensity. Readers must feel the main negative emotion the story focuses: despair, frustration, sadness, helplessness, etc. The expression of overwhelm must be dramatic, endearing, and true to the character.

**Length:** 3-7 lines

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

A deep regulation cycle to manage intense emotions and prepare for new thinking. This can be full co-regulation with a caregiver or a subtler interaction. Show positioning, touch, and validation concisely and endearingly.

**Psychology:**
- A full co-regulation sequence (max 3 exchanges, embedded in action).
- **Support Types:** Calm Presence, Physical Contact, Intentional Connection, Feeling Validation, Emotional Labeling Support.
- "Notice, Pause, Help." might be introduced or remembered.
- **Child's Role:** May use "Calming Our Bodies/Minds" or "We're a Team!" strategies. Must actively participate in regulation (agency).

- 

**Engagement:** Quiet but emotionally rich, creating warmth and safety. Palpable comfort and care should be conveyed through vivid endearing sensory details (e. g., "Mom smelled like cinnamon and safety"). The child's participation in their own calming adds authenticity.

**Length:** 3-6 lines maximum

### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation

The child processes failures and discovers a solution, either independently or with adult scaffolding (e.g., socratic questions). Show the "aha" moment and new understanding.

**Psychology:**
- **Solution Discovery:** Guided Discovery, Trial/Error/Reflection, Collaborative Brainstorming, or Remembering Past Solutions.
- **Support:** Gentle Guidance, Choice Offering, Memory Scaffolding, Breaking Down Complexity.
- **Practice:** Mental Rehearsal, Pretend Play, or Practicing Coping Words/Strategies.
- The child must be the central agent in finding the solution.

**Engagement:** Cognitive but active. The "aha" moment must feel earned, showing a child's authentic process of discovery, whether through quiet insight, excitement, or serious realization.

**Length:** 3-8 lines

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

Regulated and committed, the character begins the final attempt, demonstrating growth and the new solution through their actions.

**Psychology:**
- Initiates the attempt independently (agency).
- Demonstrates learned coping strategies in action.
- Shows visible growth in approach and emotional control.

**Engagement:** High energy building to a climax for external problems, or quiet determination for internal ones. The character's new competence or grace should be visible, creating a sense of impending triumph.

**Length:** 2-5 lines

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback

The attempt is almost successful when a minor, non-catastrophic problem occurs (e.g., a tower wobbles), triggering the memory of earlier core incident or low point and creating suspense.

**Psychology:** Pure action and suspense.

**Engagement:** Maximum tension. A breath-holding moment as the outcome hangs in the balance.

**Length:** 2-5 lines

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested -> Learned Skill -> Persistence

Facing the setback, the character feels old negative emotion rise, but consciously uses the learned skill (e.g., takes a deep breath) to self-regulate. Then performs the small, careful action required to 
fix the setback.

**Psychology:**
- Consciously uses coping strategies to overcome the internal hurdle.
- Solves the problem through their own decisive action, proving growth (agency).
- Support should be minimal (e.g., Partnership Language, Success Setup).

**Engagement:** The peak moment of triumphant breakthrough. The action should feel surprising yet inevitable, showing the character's earned growth. A co-regulated success should feel warm and empowering.

**Length:** 3-6 lines

### Beat 4.4: Success

The problem is clearly resolved by the character's action. This can be achieving a goal, reaching a new behavioral state (e.g., falling asleep peacefully), or finishing a task.

**Psychology:** The triumph belongs to the child (agency), even if supported.

**Engagement:** A clear and satisfying release of tension. Vivid image of what success looks like. The beat concludes right on that image, all reward goes into the next one.

**Length:** 2-5 lines

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief

An immediate positive emotional release and consequence follows success. The "reward" can be a tangible item, praise, or the direct positive outcome. Show physical joy/relief, followed by a calm satisfaction.

**Psychology:**
- Show physical joy/relief first, then a brief positive emotion label.
- The positive consequence is experienced directly.
- Praise, if given, must be specific and process-focused.
- The character drives and enjoys their success (agency).

**Engagement:** Emotional payoff. The celebration should feel genuine, ranging from exuberant joy to quiet awe. Readers should feel the character's satisfaction. A good place to use fun phrases 
that make the child laugh.

**Length:** 4-6 lines

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning

Tension fully subsides as the character processes the success, realizing the meaning of their experience in simple, concrete terms. Show understanding through expression or action with simple, concrete lesson. Learning can be named simply.

**Psychology:**
- The child owns the realization (agency).
- Support should be brief (Active Listening, Gentle Questions, Process Praise).
- Frame learning as development, not a fixed trait.
- The understanding is a discovery, not a lecture.

**Engagement:** A warm, calming, and satisfying feeling. The child's realization is expressed in their unique, authentic way.

**Length:** 1-3 lines

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo

The character's situation is transformed. This is shown through an integrated action: making amends, teaching the skill to a toy, helping someone, or confidently using the new ability. This demonstrates the new, more capable status quo. Ends with a scene depicting everything being good again.

**Psychology:**
- The child initiates the action, showing agency and embodied growth.
- Support should be minimal and only if necessary.
- Show the positive impact of the changed behavior, do not explain it.
<!-- what does line below even mean? -->
- Present integration and transformation as natural development.

**Engagement:** A satisfying resolution that contrasts with the opening. The integrated action is heartwarming, and the character's new confidence shines through their ordinary actions, showing genuine growth.

**Length:** 4-8 lines

### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought

A brief, punchy, and resonant emotional closure. The final image, action, or concise thought should speak for itself, hinting that the skill is truly internalized.

**Psychology:** Pure emotional closure.

**Engagement:** A warm, lingering ending that captures something essential about the character or their journey. A simple 
statement, a characteristic gesture, or a forward-looking question can 
provide a perfect, satisfying end note.

**Length:** 1-3 lines
