# Emotion Unfolding Sequence
## Anger

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska’s paws clenched into tight fists. A low "Grrrr!" rumbled in her chest.

2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   A hot, prickly feeling spread through her tummy. Her face felt tight and warm.

3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    <!-- Here we need to be very careful. We need to show simultaneously REAL reaction that a child can recognize and psychologically DESIRABLE reaction that the child will copy. Hitting someone in anger is real, but not desirable. Breathing out and calming down immediately is desirable, but not real. -->
    *   She turned her back on everyone and hid her face in her paws.

4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She remembered her tool and did three Strong Stomps on the ground.

## Sadness

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska’s shoulders drooped. A long, quiet sigh puffed out of her lips.

2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   Her whole body felt heavy. There was a hollow, empty space in her chest.

3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   She quietly wrapped her tail around her body, giving herself a soft hug.

4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She walked over to her mother and used her words: "Can I tell you about my feeling?"

## Fear

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska froze completely still. Her eyes grew wide and her ears went flat.

2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   Her tummy felt like it was full of fizzy butterflies. A shiver ran down her back.

3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   She made herself small and ducked behind her father’s leg, peeking out.

4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She looked at her own paw and slowly touched each finger, counting to five.
