# STORY WRITER GUIDE (V3 - CLEANED)

## OVERVIEW: NARRATIVE VS PROSE

This guide applies to both:
- **Narrative/Storyboard Writing:** Creating beat-by-beat descriptions of what happens
- **Prose Writing:** Converting narrative into final story text

Both follow identical rules. The only difference is output format:
- **Narrative Output:** "Liska noticed the moonbeam and tried to catch it, showing her playful nature"
- **Prose Output:** "Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam. She pressed low to the ground..."

## PART 1: WRITING PROTOCOL (FOR BOTH NARRATIVE & PROSE)

### 1.1. Core Writing Process

**Write iteratively. Before each beat, re-load relevant context files and ensure their content is used:**
- Character profiles for all characters in the scene
- `@4_Structure_And_Style.md` for beat requirements and prose style
- `@2_Emotional_Framework.md` for emotion descriptions and metaphors
- `@3_Developmental_Framework.md` for dysregulation, regulation, and support types
- `@5_Humor_And_Engagement.md` for engagement and fun options
- `@6_Setting.md` for location descriptions

### 1.2. Beat Implementation Guidelines

When writing each beat (narrative or prose):
- **Check beat requirements** in `@4_Structure_And_Style.md` for that specific beat
- **Select appropriate slots** from the relevant core files
- **Maintain character consistency** with their profiles
- **Follow engagement minimums** per act as defined in the structure

### 1.3. Character-Specific Writing

- **Character Files:** Always load full character context before writing their scenes
- **Voice Consistency:** Match dialogue and actions to established character traits
- **Humor Profiles:** Select Fun types that match each character's humor style

### 1.4. Narrative vs Prose Output Examples

**For Beat 2.4 (Fallout):**

**Narrative Output:**
```
Liska's ears droop and her tail goes limp. She feels a prickly hedgehog curl up in her chest (hurt/disappointment). She turns away from the broken toy, making small whimpering sounds. Shows mild dysregulation through withdrawal behavior.
```

**Prose Output:**
```
Liska's ears drooped flat against her head. Her fluffy tail, usually so bouncy, hung limp like a sad ribbon.

"My toy..." she whispered. Inside her chest, a prickly hedgehog curled into a tight ball. She turned away and made tiny whimpering sounds that would break any parent's heart.
```

## PART 2: EDITING PROTOCOLS (APPLIES TO BOTH FORMATS)

### 2.1. Narrative Polish & Deepening Protocol

**Goal:** Final polish to ensure the storyboard/prose is tight, psychologically sound, and maximally engaging.

**Process:** For each beat, analyze and refine:
- **Narrative Tightness & Pacing:** Edit for conciseness. Cut or rephrase anything that slows pace.
- **Psychological & Emotional Arc:** Verify "show, then tell" per `@2_Emotional_Framework.md`
- **Character & World Integrity:** Check consistency with profiles and `@6_Setting.md`
- **Engagement & Fun Factor:** Add micro-tensions and fun per `@5_Humor_And_Engagement.md`

**Application:**
- **For Narrative:** Ensure descriptions are clear, specific, and actionable
- **For Prose:** Ensure text is vivid, age-appropriate, and flows naturally when read aloud

### 2.2. Engagement & Fun Enhancement Protocol

**Goal:** Inject high-impact emotional snippets, fun interactions, and micro-tension.

**Output Format (for both narrative and prose):**
```
### Beat X.Y

[Current text - either narrative description or prose]

**Review:**
- A brief analysis of what works and what's boring.

**Suggestions:**
- Concrete ideas to make the beat more engaging.
- 5 **Punchy Snippet:** suggestions [Specific moments or lines]
```
    
**Opportunities for New Engagement:**
```
### Opportunity for Engagement: [Brief description]
*   **Location:** [Quote the text that could be modified]
*   **Reasoning:** [Why this needs improvement]
*   **Suggested Implementation:** [Concrete example in same format as original]
```

### 2.1. Iterative Development & Convergence
**Feedback Integration System:**
- **Memory Carry-Forward:** Address specific 
feedback without overcorrecting
- **Constraint Balance:** Balance developmental 
vs engagement based on feedback
- **Round 1:** Optimize for story appeal while 
meeting developmental minimums.
- **Round 2:** Address gatekeeper feedback while 
maintaining narrative momentum.
- **Round 3+:** Find middle-ground compromises 
satisfying all requirements.

    
### 3.2. Prose Generation Protocol
---

## PART 3: FORMAT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

### 3.1. Narrative/Storyboard Writing Guidelines

**Purpose:** Create clear, actionable descriptions for each beat

**Format Requirements:**
- Describe WHAT happens, WHO does it, and WHY it matters
- Include specific emotional/developmental elements from core files
- Note required slots (emotion types, engagement types, etc.)
- Be specific enough that anyone could write prose from it

**Example Narrative Beat:**
```
### Beat 3.5: Recovery
Papa arrives and sits beside Liska without speaking. He gently pulls her onto his lap (Physical Contact support). Liska resists at first but then melts into him. Papa breathes slowly and deeply until Liska's breathing matches his (co-regulation through Modeling Calm). He whispers "That was really frustrating when your tower fell" (Feeling Validation). Liska nods and hiccups. The prickly hedgehog in her chest slowly uncurls.
```

### 3.2. Prose Writing Guidelines

**Purpose:** Transform narrative into engaging, age-appropriate story text

**When Converting Narrative to Prose:**
1. **Maintain all story elements** from the narrative
2. **Add sensory details** and vivid language
3. **Follow prose style rules** from `@4_Structure_And_Style.md`
4. **Ensure read-aloud flow** - test by reading out loud
5. **Hit word/page limits** per beat requirements

**The Same Beat as Prose:**
```
### Beat 3.5: Recovery
Papa's warm presence filled the doorway. Without a word, he settled beside his little fox and gently scooped her onto his lap.

At first Liska stayed stiff, but Papa just breathed slowly—in and out, in and out—until her little body began to melt against him.

"That was really frustrating when your tower fell," Papa whispered into her ear.

Liska nodded and hiccuped. Deep in her chest, the prickly hedgehog slowly uncurled its spines.
```

### 3.3. Translation Guidelines (Prose Only)

- **Cultural Adaptation:** Adapt for target language audience
- **Language Quality:** Natural, fluent, idiomatic translation
- **Translation Priority:** Convey meaning, not literal translation
- **Vocabulary:** Simple, clear, natural expressions
- **Metaphors:** Keep intact but make idiomatic
- **Dialogue Formatting:** Follow language-specific rules in `@4_Structure_And_Style.md`

### 3.4. Prose Generation Process

1. **Input:** Receive narrative/storyboard with beat descriptions
2. **Process:** Transform each beat following all guidelines
3. **Output:** Polished prose under original beat headings
4. **Format:** Include ONLY the prose - no notes, suggestions, or metadata

**Complete Example:**

**Input (Narrative/Storyboard):**
```
## Act 1: Introduction
### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere

In the quiet den, a moonbeam paints a silver stripe on the floor. Liska, curious, tries to pounce on the "puddle of light," patting it in confusion when she finds it's dry. The scene establishes a feeling of safety and playful wonder.

**Suggestions:**
- Heighten the comedic anticlimax by emphasizing Liska's very serious "hunter" preparations before the pounce.
- **Punchy Snippet:** Liska's little bottom gives a mighty wiggle before she leaps.
```

**Output (Final Prose):**
```
## Act 1: Introduction
### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere

Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam. She pressed low to the ground. Her bottom gave a little wiggle and...

She pounced like a tiny predator! But her paw only patted the floor with a little *fump*. Liska furrowed her brows in confusion.
```

### 3.5. AI-Specific Constraints

- Omit all self-references, apologies, or meta-commentary
- Terminate response immediately after delivering requested output
- Apply these constraints to both narrative and prose writing
