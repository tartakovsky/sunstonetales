# Liska Project: Fun & Humor Generation Specification

## 1. Core Principles

The primary goal is to generate narratives that are emotionally resonant and genuinely funny for both children and adults. Stories must be compelling simulations of a child's inner world, not lectures with fur. All humor and plot developments must emerge organically from the established character profiles and the constraints of the story world.

## 2. World & Reality Constraints

-   **No Magic:** The narrative universe operates on plausible, real-world physics. There are no arcane abilities, magical spells, or supernatural occurrences.
-   **No Anthropomorphism of Inanimate Objects:** The laws of physics are not broken. Clouds do not wink, doors do not have hiccups, and furniture does not have feelings. Animals may have human-like thoughts and emotions, but objects remain inanimate.
-   **Setting:** The default setting is a plausible, low-fantasy, late-medieval world. Technology, social structures, and daily life should be consistent with this era.

## 3. Target Emotional & Comedic Impact

The content must elicit specific, strong reactions from its dual audience.

### 3.1 For Adults:
-   **Chuckle:** Witty observations, relatable parenting moments (`Dual-Layer Humor`), and the charmingly flawed logic of a child.
-   **"Aww":** Moments of extreme cuteness, `Adorable Effort`, vulnerability, and genuine connection between characters.
-   **Touched (Tears Welling Up):** Profound moments of empathy, parental love, a child's genuine remorse, or the successful navigation of a difficult emotion that leads to connection.

### 3.2 For Children:
-   **Laugh Out Loud (LOL):** Physical comedy (`Slapstick`), large-scale harmless messes (`The Big Mess`), and unexpected, disproportionate reactions (`Dramatic Overreaction`).
-   **"Aww":** Similar to adults, stemming from moments of `Adorable Effort` and cute vulnerability.

## 4. Humor Generation Engine

Humor must be character-driven, intentional, and executed with brevity.

# Fun Types

# Adorable Effort
## The Puffed Cheeks
- Description: A small character trying to blow, puff, or be fierce with comically inflated cheeks. The humor is in the visual of their tiny body producing such a big, cute effort.
- Examples:
  - "To blow out the candle, his cheeks puffed up like two big red apples."
  - "He tried to scare the frog by puffing his cheeks for a mighty roar, but only a little 'meow' came out."
  - "She puffed and puffed to blow a bubble, her face turning all red."

## The All-Body Wiggle
- Description: A character putting their entire body into a small, focused action. The effort is so total and earnest that their whole body wiggles, shakes, or squirms.
- Examples:
  - "To pull the carrot from the ground, the bunny pulled so hard his ears wiggled and his little tail shook."
  - "He tried to put on his sock, wiggling his whole body to get it over his toes."
  - "She drew a circle with such concentration that her tongue stuck out and her feet wiggled."

## The Puffed Cheeks
- Description: A small character trying to blow, puff, or be fierce with comically inflated cheeks. The humor is in the visual of their tiny body producing such a big, cute effort.
- Examples:
  - "To blow out the candle, his cheeks puffed up like two big red apples."
  - "He tried to roar like a lion, puffing his cheeks for a tiny 'mew!'"

## The Mighty Lift
- Description: A small character attempting to carry something comically large for them, showing immense strain in a cute, wobbly way.
- Examples:
  - "She hoisted the picnic basket one millimetre before it politely sat back down."
  - "He staggered three heroic steps with the pumpkin, then hugged it for a nap."
  - "The kitten braced, lifted the blanket corner, and collapsed in a fuzzy victory."

# Body Awareness
## Awkward Grace
- Description: The endearing clumsiness that comes from a character trying very hard to be elegant, coordinated, or controlled, but their developing body doesn't quite cooperate.
- Examples:
  - "He tried to bow like a prince but his head was too heavy, and he tumbled forward into a somersault."
  - "She tried to dance like a ballerina, spinning on one foot, but just ended up as a wobbly, giggling top."
  - "He attempted to pour tea from a toy teapot with his pinky out, but missed the cup entirely."

# Cognitive Humor
## Literal Misunderstanding
- Description: A character taking a common idiom or figure of speech literally, highlighting their charmingly concrete way of thinking.
- Examples:
  - "Mama said, 'Hold your horses.' He looked around for a horse to hold."
  - "Grandpa said, 'I'm all ears.' The girl leaned over to see if his ears had grown bigger."
  - "When Dad said he had 'butterflies in his stomach,' the boy asked if he had eaten them for breakfast."

## Naive Logic
- Description: The character explains something using flawless but incorrect logic that makes perfect sense from their limited perspective.
- Examples:
  - "'Why is it dark?' asked the bear cub. 'Because the sun went to sleep in its bed behind the mountain.'"
  - "He put dirt on his scraped knee. 'I'm planting a scab so it will grow back,' he explained."
  - "'My shadow is following me,' she said. 'I think it's lonely.'"
  - "He wore socks to bed so his dreams wouldn’t get chilly."


## The Grand Discovery
- Description: A character encounters a mundane phenomenon for the first time and reacts with the awe and wonder of a world-shattering scientific breakthrough.
- Examples:
  - "He saw his shadow and whispered, 'Look! A flat friend is stuck to my feet!'"
  - "After a spin, she saw the room was still moving. 'The whole world is wobbly!' she gasped."
  - "He spoke into a fan and heard his warbly voice. 'I have captured a robot ghost!'"

## Creative (but Flawed) Solutions
- Description: A character tries to solve a problem with a 'solution' that is creative and well-intentioned but fundamentally misunderstands how things work.
- Examples:
  - "The flower was drooping, so he put a tiny bandage on its stem to make it feel better."
  - "His drawing wasn't bright enough, so he tried to color the sun with a yellow banana."
  - "To stop the book from closing, he put a piece of cheese on the page as a 'book-stopper.'"

## Literal Misunderstanding
- Description: A character taking a common idiom or figure of speech literally, highlighting their charmingly concrete way of thinking.
- Examples:
  - "Mama said, 'Hold your horses.' He looked around for a horse to hold."
  - "Grandpa said, 'It's raining cats and dogs.' The boy looked outside for falling animals."

# Cute Incompetence
## The Terrible Hide
- Description: The classic humor of a child "hiding" in a place where they are completely visible, showing their naive understanding of object permanence.
- Examples:
  - "The bear hid behind the skinny lamp post; his big, round tummy stuck out on one side."
  - "She covered her own eyes with her hands and shouted, 'You can't see me!'"
  - "He hid under the glass table, looking right up at his mom."

## Grown-Up Mimicry
- Description: A child character trying to copy an adult's complex actions with adorable clumsiness and intense seriousness, often using toys as props.
- Examples:
  - "He adjusted spectacles (without lenses) before diagnosing the teddy with 'severe fluffiness.'"

# Emotional Expression
## The Micro-Drama
- Description: A character has an immense, theatrical emotional reaction to a very minor, low-stakes event. The humor comes from the disproportionate response.
- Examples:
  - "A single block fell from his tower. He gasped, put a hand to his forehead, and sighed, 'Oh, the tragedy!'"
  - "His crayon broke. He held the two pieces up and declared, 'It is broken... forever.'"
  - "He got a drop of jam on his shirt. 'Oh no!' he wailed. 'A terrible stain! What shall I do?'"

# Exaggerated Motion
## The Dramatic Tiptoe
- Description: A character trying to be stealthy but being extremely obvious and theatrical about it, lifting their knees high or moving in comical slow motion.
- Examples:
  - "He tiptoed past the sleeping cat, lifting his knees all the way to his chin with every... single... step."
  - "To be quiet, she walked on the very tips of her toes, wobbling side to side with her arms out like a tightrope walker."
  - "They snuck to the cookie jar in a slow-motion crawl across the kitchen floor."

## The Full-Body Shiver
- Description: An over-the-top, full-body reaction to a small, mild sensation like a cold drop of water, a tickle, or a surprising sound.
- Examples:
  - "A single drop of cold water landed on his back. He shivered a giant shiver from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail."
  - "When the feather tickled his foot, he giggled and curled up into a tight little ball."
  - "The tiny bubble went pop! and she jumped back with a surprised little squeak."

## The Dramatic Tiptoe
- Description: A character trying to be stealthy but being extremely obvious and theatrical about it, lifting their knees high or moving in comical slow motion.
- Examples:
  - "He tiptoed past the sleeping cat, lifting his knees all the way to his chin with every... single... step."
  - "To be quiet, she walked on the very tips of her toes, wobbling side to side."

# Expressive Reactions
## The Tasting Face
- Description: A character's whole face contorting in an exaggerated way after tasting something new, especially something sour, bitter, or bubbly.
- Examples:
  - "She licked the lemon. Her eyes squeezed shut and her whole face scrunched up."
  - "He took a sip of fizzy water and his nose wrinkled in surprise."

# Language & Sound
## Cute Mispronunciation
- Description: A young character saying a word slightly wrong in a way that is common for toddlers, revealing their stage of language development.
- Examples:
  - "He asked for 'pas-ghetti' for dinner."
  - "She called the helicopter a 'heck-a-lot-er.'"

# Social Behavior
## Serious Formality
- Description: A character treats a casual, playful situation with extreme, grown-up seriousness and formal manners, often learned from observing adults.
- Examples:
  - "He hosted a tea party for his toys, asking, 'Mr. Bear, would you care for another pretend biscuit?'"
  - "She answered her toy phone with, 'Good afternoon, Bear residence, Cub speaking. How may I direct your call?'"
  - "A butterfly landed on his finger. He looked at it gravely and said, 'A pleasure to make your acquaintance.'"
  - "He handed cookies on a leaf-platter: 'One must observe proper biscuit protocol.'"

## Fierce Ownership
- Description: A character's intense, serious, and sometimes illogical possessiveness over their belongings, especially mundane objects they have claimed as special treasures.
- Examples:
  - "He held up a shiny rock. 'This is my diamond. It's very, very expensive and you can't touch it.'"
  - "She patted a pile of leaves. 'This is my castle. I am the queen of all the leaves.'"
  - "He arranged three bottle caps. 'This is my treasure. The red one is gold, and the blue one is magic.'"

# Social Humor
## Innocent Honesty
- Description: A character making a blunt but true observation without any malice. The humor comes from the unfiltered truth that adults learn to avoid saying.
- Examples:
  - "The little fox looked at the king. 'Your crown is very shiny,' he said. 'And your nose is very big.'"
  - "She listened to her friend sing a song. 'That was very loud,' she said with a smile."
  - "He looked at Papa's new painting. 'It's very... brown,' he decided."
  - "'Your cake tastes… very chewy,' he praised, still chewing."


# Physical Comedy (Slapstick)
## The Harmless Collision
- Description: Two or more characters bumping into each other in a silly, bouncy way, always ending in laughter, not tears. The humor is in the sudden, unexpected physical interaction.
- Examples:
  - "The two penguins weren't looking. They bumped tummies and bounced apart like rubber balls."
  - "He ran around the corner and BONK! Right into Papa's soft belly, which wobbled like jelly."
  - "The squirrels all slid down the branch at once and landed in a big, giggly, tangled pile."

## The Slippery Slide
- Description: A character slipping on something mundane (a banana peel, a wet floor, ice) and sliding uncontrollably into a funny, safe landing. The loss of control is the source of laughter.
- Examples:
  - "The monkey stepped on the banana peel. Whoosh! He slid all the way across the kitchen floor and into a pile of soft laundry."
  - "He slid on the ice and spun around three times before landing softly in a big snowbank. Only his feet were sticking out."
  - "The floor was wet. His feet went ZIP! and he slid on his bottom right under the table."

# Surprise & Absurdity
## The Wrong Sound Effect
- Description: An animal or object making a completely unexpected and nonsensical sound, breaking the child's learned associations in a shocking and funny way.
- Examples:
  - "The big, tough lion opened its mouth to roar... and a tiny 'squeak' came out."
  - "He knocked on the big wooden door. The door answered, 'Quack!'"
  - "The little sheep bounced on the trampoline. Instead of 'Baa!', it went 'Boing! Boing! Boing!'"

## Impossible Scenarios
- Description: Presenting a situation or object that is absurdly wrong for its purpose or location, creating a nonsensical visual gag that defies all logic.
- Examples:
  - "The bear tried to ride his bicycle, but the wheels were square! Bump, bump, bump."
  - "He looked up and saw a fish flying through the sky, wearing tiny goggles and waving a fin."
  - "She opened her lunchbox and found a giggling sandwich that tried to run away."

# "Naughty" & Forbidden Fun
## The Big Mess
- Description: A character making a huge, harmless mess that would be forbidden in real life, but is hilarious in a story. The humor comes from the joy of controlled chaos.
- Examples:
  - "He jumped in the muddy puddle. SPLAT! Brown mud flew everywhere, even on top of his head."
  - "The flour bag tipped over. POOF! The whole kitchen, and the little bear, turned white like a ghost."
  - "They had a pillow fight until the whole room was filled with fluffy white feathers, like they were inside a cloud."

## Unexpected Bodily Noises
- Description: A character letting out a loud, surprising bodily sound (burp, hiccup, sneeze) at a funny moment, especially if it has an exaggerated effect on the environment.
- Examples:
  - "The quiet king took a sip of his royal juice. Then he let out a giant, echoing BUUUURP!"
  - "The giant sneezed a mighty AH-CHOO! that blew the hat right off the scarecrow's head."
  - "He got the hiccups. Each hic! was so strong it made him jump a little bit off the ground."

# Character Humor
## Dramatic Overreaction
- Description: A character reacting to a tiny, insignificant event with huge, theatrical emotion or action. The disproportionate response is what's funny.
- Examples:
  - "A single ladybug landed on the elephant's nose. 'A MONSTER!' he shrieked, and hid behind a tiny flower."
  - "The wolf saw a spider. He screamed, jumped on a chair, and pulled his feet up."
  - "His ice cream dripped once on his hand. 'Oh no!' he cried. 'It's melting! A disaster!'"

# Sudden Escalation
## The Runaway Action
- Description: A simple, controlled action suddenly becomes an unstoppable, chaotic event. The humor comes from the violent, unexpected loss of control.
- Examples:
  - "He started spinning in a circle. But he couldn't stop. He spun faster and faster until he drilled a hole right through the floor."
  - "She started to roll the snowball. It rolled away from her, getting bigger and bigger until it scooped up the snowman and rolled right out of town."
  - "He blew one bubble. The bubble didn't pop. It just kept getting bigger until it lifted him off the ground."

# Physical Betrayal
## The Object's Revenge
- Description: An everyday object doesn't just fail; it actively does the opposite of what's intended, in a way that's comically unhelpful or embarrassing.
- Examples:
  - "He closed the book; it popped open and bonked his nose good-night."
  - "The spoon flicked porridge straight onto his eyebrow, sticking like decoration."
  - "Chair leg wiggled away mid-sit—floor received a surprise guest."

# Auditory Shock
## The Sound Mismatch
- Description: A sound effect is completely wrong for its source, creating a moment of pure auditory nonsense. The more serious the setup, the funnier the sound.
- Examples:
  - "The big, scary dragon opened its mouth to breathe fire... and it burped the alphabet. 'A-B-C-D-E-F-G...'"
  - "He knocked on the door. Knock, knock. The door mooed back at him. MOOO!"
  - "The mouse tried to be quiet, but its feet made loud HONKING noises with every step. HONK! HONK! HONK!"

# Absurd Logic
## The Wrong Tool for the Job
- Description: A character uses a completely, ridiculously inappropriate object to solve a problem, with unwavering confidence. The humor is in the visual of the nonsensical action.
- Examples:
  - "He tried to erase pencil marks with a slice of cucumber: 'built-in fresh smell.'"
  - "Stuck zipper? She suggested buttering it—'sliding food helps sliding clothes!'"
  - "To cool the soup, he fanned it with a frying pan: 'same family, it’ll listen.'"

# Broken Reality
## The Sudden Animation
- Description: An inanimate object comes to life without warning to perform one specific, funny action before becoming inanimate again.
- Examples:
  - "His drawing of a smiley face on the page winked at him, then went back to being a normal drawing."
  - "The garden gnome saw him trip, shook its head in disappointment, and then froze again."
  - "As she walked past, the coat on the coat rack reached out an arm and tried to steal her cookie."

# Anticlimax
## The Big Reveal Is a Dud
- Description: A moment of huge buildup and suspense leads to a reveal that is incredibly tiny, mundane, or silly. The humor is in the dramatic deflation of expectation.
- Examples:
  - "The giant, rumbling treasure chest creaked open. Inside was... a single, lost sock."
  - "The huge monster stomped into the city. It opened its giant mouth and whispered, 'Does anyone have a tissue?'"
  - "The magician shouted, 'BEHOLD!' He pulled the sheet off the cage. The tiger was gone. In its place sat a hamster, eating a tiny piece of cheese."

# Dual-Layer Humor
## Relatable Parenting
- Description: An action perfectly mirrors a universal parenting moment. The child sees a simple action, while the adult feels a deep, humorous recognition.
- Examples:
  - "Child 'helps' make a mess: 'the thank-you-for-helping smile.'"
  - "Child asks 'why' again: 'the long, slow parent breath.'"
  - "Sudden silence from child: 'the suspicious quiet.'"

## The Dry Understatement
- Description: A character reacts to a massive, chaotic event with a comically calm or technical observation. The humor is in the extreme lack of panic.
- Examples:
  - "Tower falls: 'a structural integrity issue.'"
  - "Juice spill: 'a minor containment breach.'"
  - "Jelly volcano erupts: 'an unforeseen liquidity event.'"

## Sophisticated Critter
- Description: An animal or child character expresses surprisingly complex or trendy adult preferences. The humor comes from their unexpected worldliness.
- Examples:
  - "Bear cub on story: 'the plot feels derivative.'"
  - "Squirrel rejecting nut: 'a bit too mainstream.'"
  - "Owl on worms: 'looking for something artisanal.'"

# Humor
## Silly Words and Sounds (Onomatopoeia)
- Description: Using funny-sounding nonsense words or exaggerated sounds for actions.
- Examples:
  - "Words like 'Шлёп,' 'Бум,' 'Дзынь,' 'Кап-кап,' 'Хлюп.'"
  - "'Лягушонок прыгнул в воду. ПЛЮХ! А потом высунул голову и сказал: 'КВА-КВА-ХЛЮП!''"

# Linguistic Style: Child-Like Neologisms
## The "Un-" Prefix
- Description: Apply "un-" to verbs that are not typically reversible to signify a child's magical-thinking desire to undo an action.
- Examples:
  - "I wish I could un-break it." (after dropping a toy)
  - "Papa, can you un-rip the page?"
  - "She tried to un-yell the mean word."
  - "un-stomp"
  - "un-spill"
  - "un-smudge"
  - "Let’s un-sleep the puppy, it’s playtime."


## The "-y" Suffix
- Description: Add "-y" to nouns or onomatopoeic sounds to create descriptive, feeling-based adjectives that capture a sensory experience.
- Examples:
  - "ouchy"
  - "buzzy"
  - "thumpy"
  - "klonky"
  - "splishy"

## Onomatopoeia-as-Verb
- Description: Use sound-effect words directly as verbs, giving actions a more vivid, energetic, and child-like quality.
- Examples:
  - "Raindrops plinked the roof while thunder whomped the hills."
  - "Leaves swish-swished down the lane."
  - "The door boinged open and mama shh-shhed it shut."

## Functional Descriptions
- Description: Describe objects by what they do or what they are for, especially when the proper name is unknown or too complex. This reveals a child's practical, literal worldview.
- Examples:
  - "He put on his foot-huts." (boots)
  - "Mama, get the water-pourer for the flowers." (watering can)
  - "It's dark. Light the warm-maker." (fireplace or candle)
  - "the seeing-circles" (glasses)
  - "the pointy-thing" (fork)
  - "She grabbed the crumb-chaser (broom) and swept heroically."
