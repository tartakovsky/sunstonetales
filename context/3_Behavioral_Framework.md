## Dysregulation Types

This section describes the various ways dysregulation can manifest in a child, depending on the context (with a parent, with peers, or alone).

---

### **Name: With Parent - High Distress**
*   **How it looks:** Child initiates contact, unmanaged state (crying, yelling, intense fear) towards parent.
*   **What to do:** Parent co-regulates (stay calm, offer comfort, validate, soothe); child cannot access coping skills independently.

---

### **Name: With Parent - Moderate Distress**
*   **How it looks:** Child initiates contact, distressed but more managed (worried, sad but verbal, approaching).
*   **What to do:** Parent validates feelings, supports child in using/accessing coping skills; co-regulates if needed.

---

### **Name: With Parent - Acting Out**
*   **How it looks:** Parent observes child's dysregulated behavior (throwing things, flailing, screaming) not aimed at parent; child not seeking help.
*   **What to do:** Parent ensures safety, sets boundary if needed (e.g., "No throwing"), then co-regulates and seeks to understand trigger.

---

### **Name: With Parent - Directed Aggression**
*   **How it looks:** Child initiates with physical (hitting) or intense verbal aggression (yelling insults) directed at parent.
*   **What to do:** Parent ensures own safety, firmly states boundary (e.g., "I won't let you hit me"), then co-regulates once aggression de-escalates.

---

### **Name: With Parent - Over-Excited**
*   **How it looks:** Child's positive emotion becomes too high, uncontrolled, difficulty responding to calming cues from parent.
*   **What to do:** Parent co-regulates to calm child, validates excitement then redirects energy (e.g., "Wow, so much energy! Let's try a calming game.").

---

### **Name: With Parent - Withdrawn**
*   **How it looks:** Parent observes child is "shut down," unresponsive, not communicating.
*   **What to do:** Parent gently connects, offers safety & quiet presence (e.g., sit nearby), co-regulates without pressure for verbalization.

---

### **Name: With Peers - High Distress**
*   **How it looks:** Overwhelmed (crying, wailing, intense fear) in presence of peers; may/may not be directed at peers as call for help.
*   **What to do:** Show varied peer reactions (help, ignore, worsen) and distressed child's responses/coping attempts within the social dynamic.

---

### **Name: With Peers - Moderate Distress**
*   **How it looks:** Upset (crying softly, frustrated, verbalizing distress) with peers nearby; might try to get peer support.
*   **What to do:** Show child's attempts to communicate distress, self-regulate, or seek peer support; illustrate peer interactions & social problem-solving.

---

### **Name: With Peers - Acting Out**
*   **How it looks:** Dysregulated behavior (throwing shared toys, disrupting group) not aimed at specific peer but impacting group.
*   **What to do:** Show impact on group dynamics, varied peer reactions, and natural social consequences (e.g., game stops, peers withdraw).

---

### **Name: With Peers - Directed Aggression**
*   **How it looks:** Physical (hitting, pushing) or intense verbal aggression directed at a peer.
*   **What to do:** Show immediate peer reactions to aggression, conflict, consequences, and potential peer interventions (safety focus for all).

---

### **Name: With Peers - Over-Excited**
*   **How it looks:** Group energy or individual's energy becomes dysregulated, play gets wild/unsafe among peers.
*   **What to do:** Illustrate group dynamics with escalating energy, peer attempts to manage (or escalate further), and potential for accidents or game breakdown.

---

### **Name: With Peers - Withdrawn**
*   **How it looks:** Shuts down during peer interaction or in a group setting, becomes non-interactive.
*   **What to do:** Show child's internal state/coping attempts alongside varied peer (non)reactions (e.g., peers might not notice, or one might gently try to engage).

---

### **Name: Alone - High Distress**
*   **How it looks:** Visibly overwhelmed by emotion when alone (uncontrolled crying, intense fear responses, no clear coping).
*   **What to do:** Show child's raw, unmanaged emotional state and any instinctual self-soothing attempts (e.g., hiding, holding self) or gradual shift.

---

### **Name: Alone - Moderate Distress**
*   **How it looks:** Upset when alone but not completely overwhelmed (soft crying, verbalizing feelings to self).
*   **What to do:** Show child actively attempting a learned coping strategy (e.g., breathing, self-talk, comfort object) and the internal process of trying to self-regulate.

---

### **Name: Alone - Acting Out**
*   **How it looks:** Dysregulated behavior (throwing things around room generally, flailing) when alone, unmanaged energy.
*   **What to do:** Show child's unmanaged energy release and its potential (accidental) negative consequences (e.g., a toy breaks, makes a mess, leading to a new feeling).

---

### **Name: Alone - Directed Aggression**
*   **How it looks:** Directs physical aggression (hitting, kicking, throwing) at toys, furniture, etc., out of intense emotion.
*   **What to do:** Show child's intense physical expression of emotion on objects and potential resulting feelings or self-discoveries (e.g., regret, calm, realization of broken toy).

---

### **Name: Alone - Over-Excited**
*   **How it looks:** Becomes dysregulated from positive emotion when alone, play becomes wild, loses control.
*   **What to do:** Show child's escalating energy leading to natural consequences (e.g., minor accident like tripping, making a large mess, which might then shift their state).

---

### **Name: Alone - Withdrawn**
*   **How it looks:** Shuts down alone due to an internal feeling or recent event, becomes passive and unresponsive to environment.
*   **What to do:** Show child's internal shutdown, quietness, and any slow internal shift or subtle environmental trigger (e.g., sunlight, a familiar sound) that starts re-engagement.

## Regulation Strategies

This section outlines the procedural flow for managing emotional dysregulation in different social contexts.

---

### **Parent-Child Co-Regulation Options**

1.  **Child:** Behaves according to the selected trigger.
2.  **Parent**
    *   IF child's behavior crosses boundaries OR has immediate safety risk:
        *   Ensures safety (Physically prevent harm; remove object/child)
        *   Calmly states the boundary (Clear, firm, short: "No hitting.")
    *   `Support`: `Calm Presence`
    *   `Support`: `Intentional Connection` (Eye level; soft voice; gentle touch if okay)
    *   `Support`: `Physical Contact` (let me give you a hug, if okay)
    *   `Support`:  `Acknowledge Emotions` (I see you’re feeling angry)
    *   `Support`: `Validate Emotions` (It's okay to feel that: "It's okay to be mad.")
3.  **Child:** De-escalates somewhat
4.  **Parent:**
    *   Slot: Parent asks if child wants to use a known `Coping Strategy` together
    *   `Support`: `Active Listening`. Listens actively if the child wants to talk (Nod; "Mm-hmm"; repeat back what child says)
    *   At this point regulation is typically done. The next step, if appropriate, is moving on to solution building or just returning to normal activities

---

### **Peer Interaction Options (Children C1, C2, C3)**

**C1:** Behaves according to the selected `Emotional Trigger`

*   Slot: `Coping Strategy` (Optional, C1 tries self-regulation first)

#### **C2 tries to help**

*   Slot: `Support` type that C2 offers (child version: "Are you okay?" "Do you want to play?" "I can help!")
*   C1 gets better
    *   C1 calms; positive peer interaction successful (Show: Helping works; accepting help is good)
*   C1 stays dysregulated
    *   Helper's attempt doesn't immediately work; situation may persist or shift. C2 might try again, withdraw, or seek adult help (Show: Trying to help is good, even if not instant; persistence or getting help)
    *   Slot: `Dysregulation` potentially for C2
    *   Slot: `Coping Strategy` for C2 if hurt by failed attempt
    *   Slot: `Support` or `Coping Strategy` C2 might try again, typically some other simple support strategy, or getting help from adults
*   C1 escalates
    *   C1's distress increases despite C2's help; C2 may withdraw or get overwhelmed (Show: Sometimes help isn't received; helper can step back)
    *   Slot: `Coping Strategy` (C2 self-protects: steps back, finds adult)

#### **C2 escalates**

*   C1 escalates: Both children dysregulated
    *   **Adult Intervention Required**
    *   Slot: `Adult ensures safety` (Separates children if needed).
    *   Slot: `Adult applies Parent-Child Co-Regulation Sequence` for both children (either one after the other, or as a group)
    *   Slot: `Post-Regulation Support` (e.g., `Gentle Guidance Questions` to help them talk it out).
    *   **Story Message**: Aggression leads to more problems; adults help everyone calm down.
*   C1 escapes
    *   Slot: `Coping Strategy`
    *   C1 removes self from conflict; problem unresolved but immediate escalation avoided (Show: Walking away is a valid choice)
*   C3 interferes
    *   Slot: `Support` (C3 offers peer mediation: "Stop!" "Let's all calm down!")
    *   C3 attempts to mediate or stop escalation; outcome varies (Show: Friends can help stop fights; helpful bystander)

#### **C2 ignores**

*   C1 escalates
    *   Slot: `Coping Strategy` (C1 might try getting attention differently)
    *   C1's distress/behavior intensifies to get attention or due to feeling unheard (Show: Being ignored feels bad; can worsen things)
*   C1 escapes
    *   Slot: `Coping Strategy` (C1 self-soothes or seeks other help)
    *   C1 withdraws, feeling unheard/rejected; may try to self-soothe or problem remains (Show: It's okay to step away if ignored; self-care)
*   C3 helps
    *   Slot: `Support` (C3 offers what C2 didn't: "I see you're sad," comfort)
    *   C3 steps in to support C1 when C2 ignores; positive bystander action (Show: Noticing and helping someone ignored is kind)

---

### **Child Alone Self-Regulation Options**

*   **Child:** Behaves according to the selected trigger (e.g., cries, freezes, stomps).
*   **IF fully unable to regulate, a natural transition occurs:**
    *   **Path A: Natural Consequence.** The child's action leads to an immediate, tangible outcome that shifts their emotional state (e.g., a thrown toy breaks, leading to surprise and sadness).
    *   **Path B: Emotional Peak Passes.** The child's energy is spent, and the intense emotion subsides naturally over a short time (e.g., big sobs turn into quiet sniffles).
*   **Child: Attempts a learned coping strategy.**
    *   **Slot: `Coping Strategy`**. The child recalls and actively uses a specific skill from the list.
        *   Examples: `My Special Comfort Item` (hugging a bear), `Simple Self-Talk` ("I can do this"), `Cooling Breaths`, `Strong Stomps`.
*   **Outcome of Coping Attempt:**
    *   **IF strategy is effective:**
        *   The child feels noticeably calmer and is now able to think or act more clearly.
        *   **Story Message:** I can use my tools to help myself feel better.
    *   **ELSE strategy is partially effective OR needs repetition:**
        *   The child shows persistence. The calming effect is minimal but allows for a small next step.
        *   **Optional Slot: `Second Coping Strategy Attempt`**. The child either repeats the first strategy or tries a different one. (e.g., After `Strong Stomps`, they try `Belly Buddy Breathing`).
        *   **Story Message:** It's okay if it doesn't work perfectly the first time. Trying is what helps.

*   **Usage Examples:** "Wait... this stick could be...", "What if this box was a boat instead?", "I can use my sweater like a blanket for my doll!"

---

### **Process: Need Recognition & Information/Tool Seeking**
*   **Description:** The child realizes they need a specific tool or information - this is the discovery moment. (The actual asking/finding is execution.).
*   **Usage Examples:** "I need something long.", "I don't know how to do this. I should ask.", "There must be something that can help me reach."

---

### **Process: Simple Sequential Planning**
*   **Description:** Child independently thinks through 2-3 basic steps before acting (distinct from guided discovery by being self-initiated).
*   **Usage Examples:** "First I'll get the stool. Then I'll climb up. Then I'll get the book.", "I need to put on my boots, then go outside."

---

### **Process: Story/Narrative-Based Discovery**
*   **Description:** Child draws on stories, fairy tales, or narratives they know to find solution approaches.
*   **Usage Examples:** "Like in the story where the mouse was clever...", "The princess in my book did...", "I remember the bear who...", "What would my favorite character do?"

---

### **Process: Environmental Scanning**
*   **Description:** Child systematically looks around their environment for clues, patterns, or resources that might inspire solutions (beyond just tool-seeking).
*   **Usage Examples:** "Let me look around and see...", "What else is here that might help?", "I see how the trees bend...", "Look how the water flows around the rock."

---

### **Process: Perspective-Taking Discovery**
*   **Description:** Child imagines how someone else would approach the problem or what they would need/want, generating new solution ideas.
*   **Usage Examples:** "What would Granny do?", "How would my little sister reach this?", "If I were the toy, what would I want?", "Maybe from over there it looks different."

---

### **Process: Analogical Thinking**
*   **Description:** Child connects current problem to different domains or experiences, not just similar past problems. Creates bridges between unlike things.
*   **Usage Examples:** "This is like when I stack dishes!", "Building friends is like planting seeds.", "The blocks are fighting like in my story.", "It's like making soup - I need to mix things."

---

### **Process: Body/Feeling-Based Discovery**
*   **Description:** Child pays attention to physical sensations or emotional "gut feelings" to guide solution discovery. Different from trial-error because it's about internal sensing rather than external testing.
*   **Usage Examples:** "This feels right in my tummy.", "My body is saying 'yes' to this idea.", "Something feels off about that way.", "I have a feeling this will work."
