## Emotional Metaphor System

This system provides consistent metaphors to represent emotions, designed to be thematically consistent (natural & geological), somatically accurate (matching physical sensations), and pedagogically sound.

---

### **1. Anger (Internal Pressure) → Little Volcano (Вулканчик)**
*   **Emotion:** Internally-generated anger and building pressure. This system also models **Frustration**, which is the early stage of the Volcano process.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   **Frustration (Early Stage):** A low-grade "grumbling and puffing" (ворчание и пыхтение). A feeling of being stuck or repeatedly blocked.
    *   **Anger (Late Stage):** Pressure building in the chest and stomach, heat rising to the face, a feeling of being about to erupt.
    *   Clenched fists and a tight jaw, like the ground rumbling.
    *   A tight throat.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > В груди у Лиски начал просыпаться маленький Вулканчик. Сначала он просто недовольно пыхтел от того, что ничего не получалось. Но потом он стал разгораться всё сильнее, и ей стало жарко-жарко, а кулачки сжались сами собой.
    > (A little Volcano started to wake up in Liska's chest. At first, it just puffed with displeasure because nothing was working out. But then it started to burn hotter and hotter, and her fists clenched all by themselves.)

---

### **2. Joy (Warmth & Contentment) → Purring Kitten (Мурлыкающий Котёнок)**
*   **Emotion:** Joy, happiness, contentment, positive memories.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   Warmth spreading through the chest and body.
    *   A sense of lightness, safety, and ease.
    *   A low, pleasant rumble in the chest.
    *   An involuntary smile.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > И тут Лиска вспомнила, как мама её обняла, и в груди у неё замурлыкал тёплый котёнок. Он согрел её изнутри, и губы сами растянулись в улыбке.
    > (And then Liska remembered how her mom hugged her, and a warm Kitten started to purr in her chest. It warmed her from the inside, and her lips stretched into a smile all on their own.)

---

### **3. Sadness (Heaviness & Tears) → Rainy Cloud (Дождливая Тучка)**
*   **Emotion:** Sadness, disappointment, sorrow.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A heavy feeling in the chest, head, and shoulders.
    *   The world appearing grey, muted, and colorless.
    *   Eyes welling up with tears, like a cloud filling with rain.
    *   A lump in the throat.
    *   Feeling physically slow and heavy.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Над Лиской нависла тяжёлая Дождливая Тучка. Всё вокруг стало серым, а в горле появился комок. Она почувствовала, как в глазах собираются капельки дождя.
    > (A heavy Rainy Cloud hung over Liska. Everything around turned grey, and a lump formed in her throat. She felt raindrops gathering in her eyes.)

---

### **4. Hurt (External Impact) → Stinging Wasp (Жалящая Оса)**
*   **Emotion:** The initial shock, sting, and pain of an unfair action or comment.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A sudden, sharp sting in the chest, as if pricked by a needle.
    *   A sharp intake of breath.
    *   A localized point of intense, hot emotional pain.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Слова Анжи ужалили Лиску, как оса. Она вскрикнула — не громко, а так, внутри — и почувствовала, как в груди стало колко и больно.
    > (Anji's words stung Liska like a Wasp. She cried out—not aloud, but inside—and felt a sharp, painful sting in her chest.)

---

### **5. Indignation (Reaction to Hurt) → Raging Lion (Яростный Лев)**
*   **Causal Link:** The `Stinging Wasp` awakens the `Raging Lion`.
*   **Emotion:** Hot, righteous anger reacting to perceived injustice. The initial roar.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   Heat spreading rapidly through the body.
    *   A racing heart and a powerful urge to roar or shout.
    *   A narrow, intense focus on the injustice.
    *   A feeling of power and the need to defend one's territory.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Там, где ужалила оса, проснулся и зарычал яростный лев. Лицо у Лиски вспыхнуло, а в голове была только одна горячая мысль: «Это нечестно!»
    > (Where the Wasp stung, a Raging Lion awoke and roared. Liska's face flushed, and there was only one hot thought in her head: "That's not fair!")

---

### **6. Lingering Resentment → Embers (Угольки)**
*   **Causal Link:** After the `Raging Lion`'s roar subsides, it can leave behind smoldering `Embers`.
*   **Distinction from Prickly Hedgehog:** While the Hedgehog is a vulnerable, defensive hurt from a situation, Embers are a hot, directed resentment toward a person.
*   **Emotion:** `Grudge / Resentment (Обида-Злость)`. The lingering, hot resentment directed at someone for a perceived injustice. It's a persistent feeling that keeps returning to the person who caused the hurt.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A persistent, localized heat in the chest.
    *   A feeling of heaviness.
    *   Thoughts that keep returning to the injustice.
    *   The world seems obscured by a "haze" or "smoke" from the embers, making it hard to see good things.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Большой Пожар утих, но внутри остались тлеть горячие Угольки обиды. Они были тяжёлыми и мешали дышать, а от их дыма всё хорошее казалось далёким и неважным.
    > (The big Wildfire subsided, but hot Embers of offence remained smoldering inside. They felt heavy and made it hard to breathe, and their smoke made all the good things seem distant and unimportant.)

---

### **7. Prickly Hedgehog (Колючий Ёжик)**
*   **Distinction from Embers:** While `Embers` represent lingering resentment towards another person, the `Prickly Hedgehog` represents the more vulnerable, self-pitying `обида` that comes from situational disappointment (e.g., a toy breaking, a plan being cancelled, a comfort becoming a source of pain). It's a defensive posture against the world's unfairness, not a grudge against a person.
*   **Emotion:** `Обида` as vulnerable hurt, self-pity.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A tight, prickly, constricted feeling in the chest.
    *   The feeling of being curled up in a ball for self-protection.
    *   A desire to be comforted.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Вместо тёплого мурчания в груди свернулся в клубок колючий, обиженный Ёжик.
    > (The warm purr disappeared, and instead, a prickly, hurt Hedgehog curled up in her chest.)

---

### **8. Shame (Internal Self-Blame) → Sticky Mud (Липкая Грязь)**
*   **Emotion:** Shame, guilt, and the cycle of self-blame.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A heavy, dirty, weighed-down feeling.
    *   The desire to hide, become small, or disappear.
    *   Feeling stuck, with difficulty moving forward.
    *   The feeling gets worse with each recurring thought about the mistake (re-applying the mud).
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Лиске стало стыдно, как будто она сама вымазалась в Липкой Грязи. Ей хотелось спрятаться, чтобы никто её не видел. Каждая мысль о её ошибке будто добавляла ещё один тяжёлый, холодный ком.
    > (Liska felt ashamed, as if she had covered herself in Sticky Mud. She wanted to hide so no one could see her. Every thought about her mistake seemed to add another heavy, cold clump.)

---

### **9. Resolution for Shame → Warm Water (Тёплая Вода)**
*   **Action:** The act of being forgiven, comforted, or making amends.
*   **Emotion:** Relief, cleansing, reconciliation.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A feeling of cleansing and relief.
    *   The heavy weight of the "mud" lifting.
    *   A feeling of warmth and lightness returning.
    *   Being able to breathe deeply and stand up straight again.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Мама обняла Лиску и сказала: «Ошибаться не стыдно, котёнок. Я всё равно тебя очень люблю». И эти слова, полные прощения, словно Тёплая Вода, смыли с Лиски всю Липкую Грязь. Она почувствовала, как ей снова стало легко и чисто.
    > (Mom hugged Liska and said, "It's not shameful to make a mistake, kitten. I love you no matter what." And these words, full of forgiveness, washed away all the Sticky Mud like Warm Water. She felt light and clean again.)

---

*   **Causal Link:** Follows a `Performance Failure` when trying to accomplish a task.

    *   A sudden loss of internal energy and structure, like a balloon losing its air.
    *   A feeling of becoming limp, heavy, and small.
    *   The body feels unresponsive, floppy, and unable to act.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Лиска попробовала ещё раз, но снова не получилось. Она почувствовала, что сдувается как воздушный шарик. Фшшш... — вся её уверенность и силы вышли, и она осталась лежать на полу мягким, беспомощным комочком. "Я не могу," — прошептала она.
    > (Liska tried again, but again she failed. She felt herself deflating like a balloon. Whoosh... — all her confidence and energy went out, and she was left lying on the floor a soft, helpless little lump. "I can't," she whispered.)

    *   Limbs becoming heavy, stiff, and unresponsive.
    *   Feeling fragile, as if a single touch could shatter you.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Внутри у Лиски всё застыло, и она почувствовала, что превращается в холодную Сосульку. Она не могла ни пошевелиться, ни вымолвить ни слова, только стояла, хрупкая и неподвижная.
    > (Everything inside Liska froze, and she felt herself turning into a cold Icicle. She could neither move nor utter a word, just stood there, fragile and motionless.)

---

### **12. Fear (Flight Response) → Little Mouse (Мышонок)**
*   **Emotion:** The overwhelming, instinctual urge to flee, shrink, and hide.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A tiny, racing heartbeat.
    *   Feeling very small in a very big, dangerous world.
    *   A desperate, all-consuming need to find a small, dark place to hide.
    *   A frantic, scurrying energy.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Лиска почувствовала себя крошечным Мышонком. Сердечко застучало быстро-быстро, как маленький барабанчик, и ей отчаянно захотелось забиться в самую узкую щёлочку, чтобы её никто-никто не нашёл.
    > (Liska felt like a tiny Little Mouse. Her heart started beating fast-fast, like a little drum, and she desperately wanted to squeeze into the narrowest crack so that nobody, nobody could find her.)

---

    *   A low-frequency tremor of contained energy.
    *   Muscles locked tight.
    *   The feeling that any further pressure will result in a painful, automatic, and defensive release.
*   **Narrative Example:**

    > (Liska wanted to build a bridge. Anji said to put the heavy stone on the bottom, but the Kebab Man said it should go on top. The thoughts in Liska's head got mixed up, like threads in a Tangled Yarn. She didn't know who was right, and this made her feel anxious and lost.)

    > (The block tower fell again. Liska sighed. For a moment, she felt herself wobble from the setback, ready to give up. But then she imagined herself as a tumbler toy. The failure pushed her, but after wobbling, she stood straight again.)

    > Лиска представляла, как они пойдут в парк. Но тут мама сказала: "Мы не можем пойти, начался сильный дождь." Внутри у Лиски всё поникло, словно красивый цветок, который вдруг завял.
    > (Liska imagined going to the park. But then Mom said, "We can't go, it's started to rain heavily." Inside Liska, everything drooped, like a beautiful Flower that had suddenly wilted.)

### **18. Temptation (Irresistible Pull) → Magnetic Rock (Магнитный Камень)**
*   **Causal Link:** Occurs when an immediate, desirable object or action captures attention, creating a strong pull in conflict with rules or delayed gratification.
*   **Emotion:** Temptation. The intense, urgent desire to act on an impulse.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A strong, invisible "tug" in the chest or hands, pulling toward the object of desire.
    *   A restless, tingling excitement in the body, urging action.
    *   A narrowing focus, where the desired object feels like the only thing in the world.
    *   A warm, itchy feeling of wanting that grows stronger the longer it's resisted.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > Лиска увидела блестящую игрушку на столе. Её не разрешали трогать, её лапки как магнитом тянуло к игрушке. Ей так хотелось схватить её прямо сейчас, что всё тело зудело от желания.
    > (Liska saw a shiny toy on the table. She wasn't allowed to touch it, pulling her paws like a magnet toward the toy. She wanted to grab it right now so badly that her whole body itched with desire.)

### **19. Envy (Coping by Devaluation) → Sour Grapes (Кислый Виноград)**
*   **Causal Link:** Follows seeing someone else have or achieve something you desperately want. It's a coping mechanism for the feeling of envy.
*   **Emotion:** `Envy`. The process of convincing yourself that something you can't have is actually bad, to make yourself feel better.
*   **Images & Sensations:**
    *   A sour, puckering taste in the mouth, like sour grapes.
    *   A grumpy, tight feeling in the cheeks and jaw.
    *   An internal voice that starts finding flaws: "It's probably not that great," "I didn't want it anyway," "Mine is better."
    *   A pouty, cross feeling.
*   **Narrative Example:**
    > У Анжи появились новые красные сапожки. Лиске так сильно захотелось такие же, что во рту стало кисло. "Пф-ф," — фыркнула она. — "Наверное, они жмут. Мои лапки и без них быстрее бегают".
    > (Anji got new red boots. Liska wanted a pair so badly her mouth turned sour. "Pfft," she snorted. "They probably pinch. My own paws can run faster without them.")

## Emotion Unfolding Sequence

This section defines the step-by-step process of how specific emotions manifest in a character.

---

### **Anger**

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska’s paws clenched into tight fists. A low "Grrrr!" rumbled in her chest.
2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   A hot, prickly feeling spread through her tummy. Her face felt tight and warm.
3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    <!-- Here we need to be very careful. We need to show simultaneously REAL reaction that a child can recognize and psychologically DESIRABLE reaction that the child will copy. Hitting someone in anger is real, but not desirable. Breathing out and calming down immediately is desirable, but not real. -->
    *   She turned her back on everyone and hid her face in her paws.
4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She remembered her tool and did three Strong Stomps on the ground.

### **Sadness**

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska's shoulders drooped. A long, quiet sigh puffed out of her lips.
2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   Her whole body felt heavy. There was a hollow, empty space in her chest.
3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   She quietly wrapped her tail around her body, giving herself a soft hug.
4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She walked over to her mother and used her words: "Can I tell you about my feeling?"

---

### **Fear**

1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Liska froze completely still. Her eyes grew wide and her ears went flat.
2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   Her tummy felt like it was full of fizzy butterflies. A shiver ran down her back.
3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   She made herself small and ducked behind her father’s leg, peeking out.
4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She looked at her own paw and slowly touched each finger, counting to five.

### **Disappointment**

0.  **The Preceding Hope (Anticipation):**
    *   Liska's body was buzzing with excitement. Her eyes were bright and she was leaning forward, imagining the fun she was about to have.
1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Her bright, expectant face melted and slackened. Her body froze for a moment, processing the shock of the loss.
2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   A sudden, sickening lurch hit her stomach. A heavy, empty thud filled her chest, as if a stone had just dropped.
3.  **Transition to Emotional Pathway:**
    *   This moment of disappointment, captured by the 'Dropping Stone (Упавший Камень)' metaphor, is a brief transitional event. It immediately leads to one of three emotional states: Sadness, Anger, or Helplessness. All subsequent body language, internal feelings, and coping strategies (both instinctive and learned) are governed by the resulting emotion as defined in project documents.
4.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   Take from the resulting emotion
5.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   Take from the resulting emotion

### **Temptation**

0.  **The Initial Attraction (Anticipation of Reward):**
    *   Liska's body buzzed with excitement. Her eyes locked onto the object of desire, imagining the immediate reward.
1.  **The Signal (Expression/Output):**
    *   Her body leaned slightly toward the object, as if drawn by an invisible force. Her paws twitched and reached slightly, then pulled back. Her eyes fixated intensely, and her breathing became quick and shallow. Her tail tip flicked rapidly with restless energy.
2.  **The Description (Internal Feeling):**
    *   A strong, invisible tug pulled at her chest and hands, urging her toward the object. A restless, tingling excitement filled her body, narrowing her focus to the temptation. A warm, itchy feeling of wanting grew stronger with each moment she resisted.
3.  **Instinctive Comfort Action (Coping, Response, Automatic Compensation):**
    *   She took a small step closer to the object, drawn by the pull, before catching herself. Her paw hovered near it, trembling with the urge, or she turned her head away briefly, though her eyes kept darting back.
4.  **The Learned Compensation (Learned Behavior):**
    *   She repeated a simple self-talk phrase like "Wait, think, ask," to slow her impulse, or counted to five slowly, or took deep breaths to break the fixation and pause the want, as taught by her parents.
