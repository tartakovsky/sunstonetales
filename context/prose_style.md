# Prose Style Guide (Ages 4-6)

This guide provides unified style and formatting rules for writing children's stories for 4-6 year olds in both English and Russian.

## 1. Core Principles

-   **Show, Don't Tell**: Describe actions to imply emotion.
    -   **Instead of**: "Liska was curious."
    -   **Write**: "Liska tilted her head. Her ears twitched."
-   **Conversational character**: Write as if a person is telling the story orally.
-   **Use age-approptiate language** for 5-6 year olds that parents speaking to children, or children speaking to each other, would use. Do not use awkward phrases, make it flow.
-   **Include connecting words** that facilitate smooth spoken delivery.
-   **Natural storytelling flow**: Use transitions and phrases that sound natural when spoken aloud.
-   **Rhythmic quality**: Ensure sentences have a pleasant cadence for parent-child reading sessions.
-   **Tense & Person**: Write exclusively in the 3rd person, past tense.

## 2. Document & Page Structure

-   **Total Text Length**: 500-800 words.
-   **Page/Line Word Count**: 15-30 words. You must observe the word count per line.
-   **Page/Line Sentence Count**: 2-4 sentences.
-   **Format**: Each line of text in the draft represents one page. Do not use page numbers. Insert an empty line between each line/page.

### Example (Line Split Format)

This shows how to correctly split output into multiple lines. Each line represents a "page" in a picture book.

**CORRECT:**
The text is grouped into paragraphs, with an empty line between them. Each paragraph represents a single "page" or illustration in the book.

> Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam. She pressed low to the ground. Her bottom gave a little wiggle and...
>
> She pounced like a tiny predator! But her paw only patted the floor with a little *fump*. Liska furrowed her brows in confusion.

**INCORRECT:**
Each sentence is on a new line, which breaks the flow and is not the correct format.

> Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam.
> She pressed low to the ground.
> Her bottom gave a little wiggle and...
> She pounced like a tiny predator!
> But her paw only patted the floor with a little *fump*.
> Liska furrowed her brows in confusion.

## 3. Sentence & Vocabulary

-   **Rhythmic Flow**: Vary sentence length to create a natural, pleasant cadence. Avoid choppy sentences.
    -   **Instead of**: "Liska was confused. She tilted her head."
    -   **Write**: "Liska tilted her head in confusion."
-   **Connecting Words**: Use simple connectors (e.g., "And," "But," "So," "Then") to create a smooth, flowing narrative.
-   **Simple Vocabulary**: Prioritize common nouns and verbs that a 5-year-old can easily understand.
-   **Adjective Rule**: Use only simple, concrete adjectives. Avoid abstract or multi-syllabic words.
    -   **Use**: `big`, `soft`, `happy`, `little`, `red`, `warm`.
    -   **Avoid**: `tremendous`, `ethereal`, `melancholy`, `minuscule`, `crimson`, `tepid`.


## 4. Literary Devices

-   **Story Titles**: Must be descriptive, specific, and memorable. They should convey both meaning and a specific situation.
    -   **EN Example**:
        - Good: "Liska Saves for a Kebab"
        - Bad: "Liska Learns To Save Money"
    -   **RU Example**:
        - Good: "Лиска копит на шашлычок"
        - Bad: "Лиска учится копить деньги"
-   **Metaphors and Images**: Must be simple, visual, and immediately understandable. They must be adapted to maintain emotional impact and cultural resonance for each target language.
-   **Refrains and Repeated Phrases**: Must be memorable, emotionally resonant, and easy for a child to chant.
    -   **EN Example**: "Afraid, but trying."
    -   **RU Example**: "Боюсь, но пробую"

## 5. Cultural Adaptation
-   **Names and Cultural Elements**: Adapt concepts to natural Russian equivalents (e.g., "Meat pastry" → "чебурек").
-   **Refrains and Repeated Phrases**: Adapt refrains to be memorable and emotionally evocative in Russian (e.g., "From Purr to Growl" → "Мурчалки-рычалки").

## 6. Dialogue Formatting

### English

-   Enclose dialogue in double quotation marks (`"`).
-   Place punctuation like commas, periods, and question marks **inside** the closing quotation mark.
-   **Correct Example**:
    ```
    "Let's build a fort," said Liska.

    "Okay!" squeaked Anji. "I'll get the blankets."
    ```
-   **Incorrect Example**:
    ```
    'Let's build a fort', said Liska.

    "Okay!", squeaked Anji. "I'll get the blankets".
    ```

### Russian

-   Use an em-dash (`—`) to introduce dialogue. Do not use quotation marks (`«»` or `""`).
-   **Correct Example**:
    ```
    — Давай построим форт, — сказал Лиска.

    — Хорошо! — пискнула Анжи. — Я принесу одеяла.
    ```
-   **Incorrect Example**:
    ```
    «Давай построим форт», — сказал Лиска.

    «Хорошо!», — пискнула Анжи, — «я принесу одеяла».
    ```

## 7. Flagging for Review

**Mark in bold** any passages that are difficult to write while adhering to all rules. This allows for an editorial decision. Flag passages that involve:

-   Cultural concepts that may not be universally understood or easily translated.
-   Wordplay or puns that are difficult to execute with simple language.
-   Complex emotional states that are hard to convey through simple actions ("show, don't tell").
-   Abstract concepts that resist simplification.
