# 4. Five-Act Story Structure

This document defines the story structure for ages 4-5 with clear requirements for each beat.

---

## Core Principles of Application

- **Narrative Flow (Time & Scene):** Transitions between beats can include time jumps (e.g., "The next day...") or scene changes (e.g., "Back at home...") to serve the story's logic. This is especially crucial for narratives about habit formation or those spanning multiple locations.
- **Story Archetypes:** The structure is designed to be flexible for different narrative types, including external problem-solving, internal/behavioral challenges (e.g., fear, habits), and goal-achievement (e.g., saving up for something). Adapt the emotional intensity and nature of the "problem" accordingly.

---

## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Setting and Atmosphere

Create an evocative environment that establishes initial emotional tone and draws readers in immediately. Show the world through 1-2 vivid sensory details (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) using only concrete descriptions. Must start as a storytelling intro like "That day Liska", "One day", "That morning in Sunstone", etc.

**Psychology:** None of the developmental rules apply here. This is pure world-building only. Focus on creating immediate sensory engagement without emotional labeling.

**Engagement:** Must create immediate "aww", "ooh", or laugh response. The goal is to make the familiar world feel fresh and engaging through a child's perspective. Think about how sensory details can surprise and delight, how scale can create wonder, or how simple transformations of everyday things can feel extraordinary.

**Length:** 1-2 lines maximum

### Beat 1.2: Introduce Character(s)

Present main character(s) and their interpersonal dynamics in their initial state through endearing, engaging actions and/or dialogue. Show character traits through specific actions and behaviors. Use "show, don't tell" exclusively. Establish personality without emotional labeling.

**Psychology:** None of the developmental rules apply. Establish personality only. Character must drive their own actions (agency).

**Engagement:** Must create immediate "aww", "wow" or laugh response through character appeal. The character should be doing something that reveals their personality while being utterly endearing. Think about how children put their whole body into efforts, their clumsy grace, or how they approach the world with complete earnestness. The action should make readers instantly care about this character.

**Length:** 2-4 lines maximum

---

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
Set the stage for the core challenge. This can be through character-specific actions, a vivid environmental setup that builds anticipation, or the establishment of a familiar routine (like getting ready for bed). The goal is to show a scene which leads toward natural progression toward the main incident.

**Psychology:** None of the developmental rules apply. Pure character/plot setup. Character acts according to their nature (agency).

**Engagement:** High anticipation building. The character should be fully absorbed in their activity, showing the kind of total engagement children have when focused on something important to them. Or the environment should be drawing the reader in and creating anticipation.

**Length:** 2-3 lines

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
The character's action or a situational event that serves as the direct trigger for the core problem. This is the cause, not the effect. It can be an external accident, an internal choice (e.g., impulsiveness), or a seemingly innocent behavior (e.g., a comforting habit). The action must be believable for the character.

**Psychology:** Focus on the character's agentic action that triggers the subsequent problem. The event should stem from the character's established nature or location, even if accidental.

**Engagement:** This is the pivot point. The catalytic event should feel both surprising and inevitable, creating a sense of "uh oh" that builds anticipation for the coming problem. Its tone can range from high-energy and comedic to quiet and foreboding.

**Length:** 2-4 lines

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
The direct consequence of the catalyst; the problem is now tangible and manifest. Show its immediate, obvious physical or emotional impact on the character, making the stakes clear. We must root for the character here or otherwise get strongly engaged with their emotions.

**Psychology:** None of the developmental rules apply. Focus on establishing the problem. Not applicable for agency as problem happens to character.

**Engagement:** This is a critical beat that must deeply engage readers with the character's situation. The problem should be presented in a way that makes readers feel for the character, whether through dramatic character reactions, vivid descriptions, or the sheer relatability of the predicament. The presentation can be humorous but must not diminish the real stakes for the character.

**Length:** 3-6 lines

### Beat 2.4: Fallout
Child's initial emotional reaction to the problem with mild dysregulation only. Show physical manifestation of negative emotions (tears, clenched fists, etc.) with minimal telling. The use of a simple, evocative emotional metaphor (e.g., "prickly hedgehog," "turning into an icicle") is allowed. One brief emotion label allowed after showing.

**Psychology:** 
- Show mild dysregulation (With Parent/Peers/Alone - Moderate to High Distress)
- One brief emotion label required after showing physical manifestation; can be supplemented with an emotional metaphor
- Character's authentic emotional response (agency)

**Engagement:** Maintain tension through authentic reaction that makes readers empathize deeply. Readers should feel that "aww", "ooh", or "oh poor thing" response. The way the character expresses their distress—whether through direct physical tells or a vivid metaphor—should be both touching and true to their personality.

**Length:** 1-3 lines

---

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Recovery (Optional)
A regulation cycle to process the initial fallout. The intensity can range from full co-regulation with a caregiver for significant emotional distress to brief self-soothing or peer comfort for milder problems. Show physical calming actions first. Brief emotion acknowledgment allowed.

**Psychology:**
- Co-regulation (can be partial or full), or self-regulation.
- Support Types: Calm Presence, Physical Contact, Intentional Connection, Feeling Validation
- Child may use simple coping strategies from "Calming Our Bodies" or "Calming Our Minds"
- Very minor solution scaffolding through questions allowed if needed for attempt 1
- May shortly introduce "Notice, Pause, Help" sequence
- Child participates in their own calming (agency)

**Engagement:** Lower tempo but maintain interest. Show the earnest ways children try to calm themselves or accept comfort. For deeper co-regulation, the scene should create a feeling of safety and care. For self-soothing, it should feel genuine and touching. Use vivid endearing sensory details.

**Length:** 1-4 lines maximum (can be just few words if emotions aren't focus)

### Beat 3.2: Attempt 1 (Initial Reaction)
Child's first, impulsive attempt to solve the problem, which may consist of a single action or a cluster of related, rapid-fire reactions. Logical from their POV but flawed. Show the attempt(s) and why they fail with only clarity-needed telling.

**Psychology:**
- Child must drive the attempt (agency, not adult solutions)
- Support Types: Minimal - Tool/Resource Offering, Gentle Guidance Questions, Signal Readiness
- Socratic Guidance: Questions/hints only to redirect from adult dependency
- Process Focus: Show working through challenge step by step, very shortly

**Engagement:** Action-focused. The attempt should reflect how children really approach problems with their unique logic and limited experience. Whether endearing in its earnestness or revealing in its naivety, it should feel authentic to how this particular character would first try to solve their problem.

**Length:** 2-7 lines (can be short if first attempt is asking adult to solve it, which they redirect)

### Beat 3.3: Attempt 2 (Developing Approach)
A different approach showing learning from the first attempt. This may result in a setback, a new complication, or show incremental progress that isn't yet a full solution (e.g., successfully saving some beads, but not enough). The difference from the first attempt should be obvious through action.

**Psychology:**
- Child initiates new approach showing some learning from previous attempt (agency)
- If attempt is complex: Show working through challenge step by step, child observes result and adjusts

**Engagement:** Build narrative momentum. Rather than strictly building to a low point, this beat shows the character's developing process. The attempt can create mounting tension, show determination, or even offer a glimpse of success that makes the final resolution more satisfying.
<!-- No, this bead builds tension up towards low point. It raises the stakes, shows progress or a new approach but in the last line always fails, leading to low point. -->

**Length:** 3-7 lines

### Beat 3.4: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)
The character confronts their limitations, resulting in a moment of emotional nadir. This can be a full breakdown, a brief but vivid expression of despair (e.g., becoming a "furry noodle"), or a behavioral relapse (e.g., giving in to temptation). Show strong physical manifestation and the practical failure. One key emotion label required.

**Psychology:**
- Dysregulation shown (can be with parent/peers or alone). The intensity can range from high distress to a quieter, potent expression of helplessness.
- Natural Consequences: Character confronts limitations and consequences of failures, possibly with a caregiver present to witness or support.
- Character's authentic breakdown or relapse.

**Engagement:** High emotional intensity. This is where readers should feel the character's despair, frustration, or helplessness most acutely. The expression of overwhelm should be dramatic and endearing, staying true to the character's unique way of experiencing big feelings.

**Length:** 3-7 lines

---

### Beat 3.5: Recovery
A deep regulation cycle to manage intense emotions and become receptive to new thinking. The approach varies by story: it can be a full co-regulation sequence with a caregiver or a more subtle interaction. Show positioning, touch, and validation in a concise, endearing way.

**Psychology:**
- Full co-regulation sequence (max 3 exchanges, embedded in action)
- Support Types: Calm Presence, Physical Contact, Intentional Connection, Feeling Validation, Emotional Labeling Support
- Child may use strategies from "Calming Our Bodies," "Calming Our Minds," (e.g., co-breathing exercises) or "We're a Team!"
- 1 emotion label and/or metaphor allowed (adult introduces)
- May introduce or reinforce "Notice, Pause, Help" sequence
- Child actively participates in regulation (agency)

**Engagement:** Quiet but emotionally rich. This beat should create warmth and safety through the co-regulation process. The physical and emotional comfort should be palpable, with details that make readers feel the security and care being provided. The child's participation in their own calming adds authenticity. Use vivid and endearing sensory details (e.g., "Mom smelled like cinnamon and safety")

**Length:** 3-6 lines maximum

---

### Beat 3.6: Re-evaluation
Child processes failures and discovers a solution. This can happen independently or through adult scaffolding, which may involve socratic questions for complex issues like habit formation. Show the "aha" moment and the new understanding.

**Psychology:**
- Solution Discovery Processes: Guided Discovery/Scaffolding (can be extensive), Trial/Error/Reflection, Collaborative Brainstorming, Remembering Past Solutions
- Socratic Guidance: Questions to help child think through problem and connect dots.
- Support Types: Gentle Guidance Questions, Choice Offering, Memory Scaffolding, Complexity Breaking
- Practice Types: Mental Rehearsal, Toy/Pretend Practice, Coping Strategy Rehearsal, Words Practice
- Child must be central agent in discovering solution, even with support/motivation.

**Engagement:** Cognitive but active. The "aha" moment should feel earned, showing how children process information to arrive at understanding. This can be a moment of quiet insight, excited discovery, or a serious realization. The discovery can also be a creative, non-linear process.

**Length:** 3-8 lines

---

## Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Final Attempt
Child implements the solution. This beat may depict the direct execution of the plan or the necessary preparation that demonstrates commitment to it (e.g., building a piggy bank). Show changed behavior demonstrating growth through action narration only.

**Psychology:**
- Child demonstrates learned coping strategies in action
- Show visible growth in approach and emotional control
- If attempt is complex: Show working through challenge step by step with new maturity
- Child initiates attempt independently (agency)

**Engagement:** High energy building to climax for external problems, or quiet determination for internal challenges (like bedtime routines). The growth should be visible, showing new competence or grace where there was struggle before, creating a sense of impending triumph.
<!-- does not seem to be very engaging, needs better rules -->

**Length:** 2-5 lines

---

### Beat 4.2: Rising Tension
Create genuine suspense as the outcome remains uncertain. This can be pure action-based tension, a moment of psychological doubt (e.g., resisting temptation), or an opportunity for empathy where the character's focus shifts to helping another. Show physical tension, effort, stakes, and uncertainty.

**Psychology:** None of the developmental rules apply. Pure action and suspense, or a test of internal resolve/empathy. Character pushes through difficulty (agency).

**Engagement:** Maximum tension for the story's context. For action stories, this is the breath-holding moment. For behavioral stories, it can be a gentle uncertainty or an internal struggle. For stories about empathy, the tension comes from whether the character will successfully help someone else.

**Length:** 2-5 lines

---

### Beat 4.3: The Turning Point
The decisive moment that proves character's growth and leads to success. This may be a single action, an application of learned behavior, a demonstration of sustained choice (e.g., resisting temptation), a decision to help another, or otherwise character being an agent in making a crucial step forward.

**Psychology:**
- Coping strategies used if overcoming internal hurdle
- Child solves problem themselves or in partnership (agency is key, but can be shared)
- Support Types: Partnership Language or Success Setup can be used, but priority is on agency and self-sufficiency.
- Decisive action, choice, or partnership proves character's growth.

**Engagement:** Peak moment of highest engagement. This is the triumphant breakthrough. The action should feel both surprising and inevitable, showing the character's growth. For co-regulation stories, the partnership should feel warm and empowering. For empathy stories, the act of helping should be the true victory.

**Length:** 3-6 lines

### Beat 4.4: Success
The problem is clearly resolved as a direct result of the child's action, choice, or partnership. For behavioral or habit-based stories, success is the new, desired state (e.g., falling asleep peacefully). For goal-oriented stories, it's achieving the target. Show the resolution and the facts of success.

**Psychology:** None of the developmental rules apply. Focus on triumph. Success belongs to the child (agency), even if achieved with support.

**Engagement:** Release of tension. The resolution should be clear and satisfying. For goal-achievement stories, this is the moment of attaining the long-awaited prize. For behavioral stories, it's a feeling of peace or accomplishment.

**Length:** 2-5 lines

---

### Beat 4.5: Immediate Reward/Relief
Positive emotional release and immediate positive consequences. The "reward" can be the direct outcome of the success, a tangible item, or praise. It should be immediate in terms of reader experience, next page after success. Show physical joy/relief first, then the consequence.

**Psychology:**
- Physical joy/relief first, then brief positive emotion label allowed
- Direct positive consequence experienced
- If praise given, use specific process praise
- Character drives and enjoys their success (agency)

**Engagement:** Emotional payoff. The celebration should be as full-bodied and genuine as children's joy really is. Whether through exuberant physical expression or character-specific ways of showing happiness, readers should feel the emotional release and satisfaction along with the character.

**Length:** 2-4 lines

---

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Catharsis/Immediate Aftermath
Tension fully subsides as characters process the success. Show satisfaction, physical relaxation, catarthic immediate aftermath.

**Psychology:** None of the developmental rules apply. Just relief and aftermath. If praise given, use specific process praise. Natural response to success.

**Engagement:** Warm, calming feeling. The wind-down should feel natural and earned, showing how the character uniquely expresses relief and contentment. This might include gentle physical comedy from exhaustion, quiet moments of satisfaction, or the particular way this character settles after excitement.

**Length:** 2-3 lines

### Beat 5.2: Reflection & Learning
Child realizes the meaning of their experience in concrete, simple terms. Show understanding through expression or action with simple, concrete lesson. Learning can be named simply.

**Psychology:**
- Child owns the realization and understanding (agency)
- Support Types: Brief - Active Listening, Gentle Guidance Questions, Process Praise
- Frame learning as development, not fixed traits
- Present understanding as discovery, not lecture

**Engagement:** Quiet satisfaction. The child's understanding should be expressed in their unique way, whether through serious pronouncements, simple observations, or childlike profundity. The realization should feel authentic to how children really process and express what they've learned.

**Length:** 1-3 lines

---

### Beat 5.3: Making it Right/Integration
If needed, child takes a concrete action that demonstrates their growth is now integrated. This is not always an apology. It can be teaching the new skill to a toy, helping someone else with a similar problem, or confidently using their new ability. Show the specific action scene.

**Psychology:**
- Child initiates concrete action showing growth (agency)
- Support Types: Minimal - only if scene implausible without it
- Show changed behavior having positive impact
- Present integration as natural development

**Engagement:** Emotionally satisfying resolution. The concrete action should demonstrate growth in a heartwarming way that feels true to the character. Whether it's a sincere gesture, taking responsibility, or showing newfound capability, it should feel like a natural expression of what they've learned.

**Length:** 2-4 lines

---

### Beat 5.4: New Status Quo
Show how the situation has transformed. The character is more capable, a new order is established, or a goal has been achieved, which becomes the new baseline. Show the changed behavior, new situation, new capability, or the earned reward as the new reality. The positive outcome can also be demonstrated through its impact on others (e.g., seeing a friend who was helped now playing confidently).

**Psychology:**
- Show transformation as development, not fixed change
- Show changed behavior/capability, don't explain it
- Demonstrate positive new state as result of growth
- Character embodies growth

**Engagement:** Satisfying contrast to opening. The transformation should be evident through the character's natural behavior, showing evolution while maintaining their essential personality. The new capability or confidence should shine through ordinary actions, creating a sense of genuine growth and change.

**Length:** 2-4 lines

### Beat 5.5: Concluding Thought
Brief, punchy emotional closure that resonates deeply without being didactic. Let the final image, action, or concise, profound thought speak for itself. It can look forward, showing the skill has been truly internalized.

**Psychology:** None of the developmental rules apply. Pure emotional closure.

**Engagement:** Warm ending that lingers. The final moment should capture something essential about the character or their journey. A simple statement, a characteristic gesture, or a forward-looking question can provide a perfect, satisfying end note.

**Length:** 1-3 lines

## Prose Style & Formatting Guide

This guide provides unified style and formatting rules for writing children's stories for 4-5 year olds in both English and Russian.

### **1. Core Principles**

*   **Show, Don't Tell**: Describe actions to imply emotion.
    *   **Instead of**: "Liska was curious."
    *   **Write**: "Liska tilted her head. Her ears twitched."
*   **Conversational character**: Write as if a person is telling the story orally.
*   **Use age-approptiate language** for 5-6 year olds that parents speaking to children, or children speaking to each other, would use. Do not use awkward phrases, make it flow.
*   **Include connecting words** that facilitate smooth spoken delivery.
*   **Natural storytelling flow**: Use transitions and phrases that sound natural when spoken aloud.
*   **Rhythmic quality**: Ensure sentences have a pleasant cadence for parent-child reading sessions.
*   **Tense & Person**: Write exclusively in the 3rd person, past tense.

### **2. Document & Page Structure**

*   **Target Audience**: 4-5 year old children (language complexity for 5-year-olds).
*   **Total Text Length**: 500-700 words maximum.
*   **Page/Line Word Count**: 15-30 words.
*   **Page/Line Sentence Count**: 2-4 sentences.
*   **Format**: Each line of text in the draft represents one page. Do not use page numbers. Insert an empty line between each line/page.

#### **Example (Line Split Format)**

This shows how to correctly split output into multiple lines. Each line represents a "page" in a picture book.

**CORRECT:**
> Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam. She pressed low to the ground. Her bottom gave a little wiggle and...
>
> She pounced like a tiny predator! But her paw only patted the floor with a little *fump*. Liska furrowed her brows in confusion.

**INCORRECT:**
> Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam.
> She pressed low to the ground.
> Her bottom gave a little wiggle and...
> She pounced like a tiny predator!
> But her paw only patted the floor with a little *fump*.
> Liska furrowed her brows in confusion.

### **2.1 Forbidden Tropes**

Never include these elements in any story:

*   **Adult lectures or "teaching conversations"**: No scenes where adults explain emotions, concepts, or lessons for more than 1-2 sentences.
*   **Magic solutions or instant emotional fixes**: All emotional regulation must be realistic and require effort from the child.
*   **Passive protagonists**: The child must never simply be told the lesson or have problems solved for them by adults.
*   **Static scenes**: Every scene must advance the plot or develop character—no pauses for pure exposition.
*   **Didactic dialogue**: Characters should never speak primarily to convey a lesson to the reader.
*   **Premature problem resolution**: Avoid resolving emotional tension too quickly with adult intervention.

### **3. Sentence & Vocabulary**

*   **Age-Appropriate Language**: All vocabulary must be simple and common for 4-5 year olds. When a complex concept is necessary, it must be explained through simple actions or dialogue. Avoid abstract nouns and complex sentence structures.
*   **Rhythmic Flow**: Vary sentence length to create a natural, pleasant cadence. Avoid choppy sentences.
    *   **Instead of**: "Liska was confused. She tilted her head."
    *   **Write**: "Liska tilted her head in confusion."
*   **Connecting Words**: Use simple connectors (e.g., "And," "But," "So," "Then") to create a smooth, flowing narrative.
*   **Simple Vocabulary**: Prioritize common nouns and verbs that a 5-year-old can easily understand.
*   **Adjective Rule**: Use only simple, concrete adjectives. Avoid abstract or multi-syllabic words.
    *   **Use**: `big`, `soft`, `happy`, `little`, `red`, `warm`.
    *   **Avoid**: `tremendous`, `ethereal`, `melancholy`, `minuscule`, `crimson`, `tepid`.
*   **Pacing Rule**: Maximum 2 consecutive paragraphs without tension, humor, or character action. Edit for conciseness, cut anything that slows the pace.

### **4. Literary Devices**

*   **Story Titles**: Must be descriptive, specific, and memorable. They should convey both meaning and a specific situation.
    *   **EN Example**:
        *   Good: "Liska Saves for a Kebab"
        *   Bad: "Liska Learns To Save Money"
    *   **RU Example**:
        *   Good: "Лиска копит на шашлычок"
        *   Bad: "Лиска учится копить деньги"
*   **Metaphors and Images**: Must be simple, visual, and immediately understandable. They must be adapted to maintain emotional impact and cultural resonance for each target language.
*   **Refrains and Repeated Phrases**: Must be memorable, emotionally resonant, and easy for a child to chant.
    *   **EN Example**: "Afraid, but trying."
    *   **RU Example**: "Боюсь, но пробую"

### **5. Cultural Adaptation**
*   **Names and Cultural Elements**: Adapt concepts to natural Russian equivalents (e.g., "Meat pastry" → "чебурек").
*   **Refrains and Repeated Phrases**: Adapt refrains to be memorable and emotionally evocative in Russian (e.g., "From Purr to Growl" → "Мурчалки-рычалки").

### **5.1 Emotion Metaphors & Co-regulation Rules**

*   **Metaphor Limits**: Stories must contain exactly 1-2 emotion metaphors maximum.
    *   Metaphors must be introduced by adult characters first
    *   They should be simple, visual, and immediately understandable to a 5-year-old
    *   Integrate metaphors into action, not as explanatory tools
*   **Co-regulation Constraints**:
    *   Maximum 3 exchanges between child and adult during any co-regulation moment
    *   Must be physical-first (hugs, positioning, touch) before verbal
    *   Embedded in action—no stopping the plot for emotional processing
    *   During high-tension moments, co-regulation must be minimal (a glance, a soft word) to avoid premature conflict resolution
*   **Emotion Sequencing**: Always follow "Show and Label" principle
    *   First: Physical manifestation (tears, clenched fists, tight shoulders)
    *   Then: Brief labeling if needed ("That's frustration making your body tight")
    *   Never reverse this order

### **6. Dialogue Formatting**

#### **English**

*   Enclose dialogue in double quotation marks (`"`).
*   Place punctuation like commas, periods, and question marks **inside** the closing quotation mark.
*   **Correct Example**:
    ```
    "Let's build a fort," said Liska.

    "Okay!" squeaked Anji. "I'll get the blankets."
    ```

#### **Russian**

*   Use an em-dash (`—`) to introduce dialogue. Do not use quotation marks (`«»` or `""`).
*   **Correct Example**:
    ```
    — Давай построим форт, — сказал Лиска.

    — Хорошо! — пискнула Анжи. — Я принесу одеяла.
    ```

### **7. Flagging for Review**

**Mark in bold** any passages that are difficult to write while adhering to all rules. This allows for an editorial decision. Flag passages that involve:

*   Cultural concepts that may not be universally understood or easily translated.
*   Wordplay or puns that are difficult to execute with simple language.
*   Complex emotional states that are hard to convey through simple actions ("show, don't tell").
*   Abstract concepts that resist simplification.
