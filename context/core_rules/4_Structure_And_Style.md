# 4. Five-Act Story Structure

This document defines the story structure for ages 4-5 with clear requirements for each beat.

---

## Core Principles of Application

- **Narrative Flow (Time & Scene):** Transitions between beats can include time jumps (e.g., "The next day...") or scene changes (e.g., "Back at home...") to serve the story's logic. This is especially crucial for narratives about habit formation or those spanning multiple locations.
- **Story Archetypes:** The structure is designed to be flexible for different narrative types, including external problem-solving, internal/behavioral challenges (e.g., fear, habits), and goal-achievement (e.g., saving up for something). Adapt the emotional intensity and nature of the "problem" accordingly.

### Child-Perspective Design

Use child viewpoint to make stories engaging. Problems come from how kids see the world - small things feel huge.

This makes obstacles real and fun. Like a puddle feeling like an ocean.

Key Ideas:
1. Real Kid-View Problems: Things big from a childs eyes, like high shelves.
2. One Sense Per Problem: Focus on one thing, like a yummy smell.
3. Short Steps: 2-3 steps to solve.
4. Kid Wants It: Solve for their own fun first, then help others.

Examples:
- High-Up Snack: Fruit smells good but too high. Jump, stool, stack cushions.
- Stuck Ball: Hear it under furniture. Reach, stick, broom.
- Puzzle Path: Hear kids but cant see. Wrong path, notice flowers, follow.

Avoid:
- Fantasy mixes like adding magic or pretend monsters that blur real and pretend.
- Too many details.
- Hard thinking.
- Adult fixes.

## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere

Start with a classic storytelling opening (e.g., "One morning," "That day..."). Introduce the main character(s) in their world through endearing and engaging actions that show their personality. Weave in 1-2 vivid sensory details (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) to establish atmosphere. The narrative can focus first on the character or the setting. Strictly "show, don't tell."

**Psychology:** No developmental rules apply. Pure world-building and character introduction. Establish personality and agency through action, creating immediate sensory engagement without emotional labels.

**Engagement:** Evoke an immediate "aww," "ooh," "wow," or laugh through character appeal and setting. The character's actions must be endearing and reveal their personality. Sensory details should present a fresh, wondrous world from a child's perspective to draw readers in.

**Length:** 3-6 lines maximum

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up

Set the stage for the core challenge through character actions, environmental setup, or a familiar routine that builds anticipation and leads naturally to the main incident.

**Psychology:** No developmental rules apply. Pure character/plot setup. Character acts with agency, true to their nature.

**Engagement:** Build high anticipation. Show the character completely absorbed in an activity or use the environment to draw the reader in.

**Length:** 2-3 lines

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

The direct trigger (cause, not effect) of the core problem. Can be an external accident, internal choice (impulsiveness), or innocent behavior (comforting habit) believable for the character.

**Psychology:** The trigger is an agentic action from the character's established nature or location, even if accidental.

**Engagement:** The pivot point. The event must feel surprising yet inevitable, creating an "uh oh" sense of anticipation, or establishing a normalized routine that leads to the problem. Tone can be high-energy, comedic, foreboding, or calm and soothing, such as demonstrating an undesirable character's habit we're dealing with in a cute and warm way if it is pleasant to them, without problematizing it.

**Length:** 2-4 lines

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident

The direct consequence of the catalyst; the problem is now tangible. Show its immediate physical or emotional impact to make the stakes clear.

**Psychology:**
- Show physical manifestation, then provide one brief emotion label.
- The emotional response must be authentic and agentic.

**Engagement:** A critical beat to engage readers with the character's plight. Use dramatic reactions, vivid descriptions, or a relatable predicament to evoke empathy. The tone can be humorous but must not diminish the character's stakes.

**Length:** 3-6 lines

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)

The child's first impulsive and flawed attempts to solve the problem. They are logical from the child's perspective but fail. A second attempt may follow and show learning, but also ends in failure.

**Psychology:**
- The attempt must be driven by the child (agency), not adults.
- Support should be minimal (e.g., offering a tool, asking guiding questions) and only if necessary, e.g. to redirect from adult dependency.

**Engagement:** Action-focused, building momentum. Attempts must reflect a child's unique logic and limited experience, creating tension, showing determination, or hinting at success.

**Length:** 4-10 lines

### Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)

The character hits an emotional and practical low point, confronting their limitations. This can be a full breakdown, vivid despair ("furry noodle"), or a behavioral relapse. Show strong physical manifestation, the practical failure, and provide one key emotion label.

**Psychology:**
- The character confronts the natural consequences of their failed attempts.
- Show dysregulation of plot-approptiate intensity (with parent/peers or alone).
- The breakdown or relapse must be authentic.

**Engagement:** High emotional intensity. Readers must feel the main negative emotion the story focuses: despair, frustration, sadness, helplessness, etc. The expression of overwhelm must be dramatic, endearing, and true to the character.

**Length:** 3-7 lines

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

A deep regulation cycle to manage intense emotions and prepare for new thinking. This can be full co-regulation with a caregiver or a subtler interaction. Show positioning, touch, and validation concisely and endearingly.

**Psychology:**
- A full co-regulation sequence (max 3 exchanges, embedded in action).
- **Support Types:** Calm Presence, Physical Contact, Intentional Connection, Feeling Validation, Emotional Labeling Support.
- "Notice, Pause, Help." might be introduced or remembered.
- **Child's Role:** May use "Calming Our Bodies/Minds" or "We're a Team!" strategies. Must actively participate in regulation (agency).

**Engagement:** Quiet but emotionally rich, creating warmth and safety. Palpable comfort and care should be conveyed through vivid endearing sensory details (e. g., "Mom smelled like cinnamon and safety"). The child's participation in their own calming adds authenticity.

**Length:** 3-6 lines maximum

### Beat 3.4: Solution Discovery

The child processes failures and discovers a solution, either independently or with adult scaffolding (e.g., socratic questions). Show the "aha" moment and new understanding.

**Psychology:**
- **Solution Discovery:** Guided Discovery, Trial/Error/Reflection, Collaborative Brainstorming, or Remembering Past Solutions.
- **Support:** Gentle Guidance, Choice Offering, Memory Scaffolding, Breaking Down Complexity.
- **Practice:** Mental Rehearsal, Pretend Play, or Practicing Coping Words/Strategies.
- The child must be the central agent in finding the solution.

**Engagement:** Cognitive but active. The "aha" moment must feel earned, showing a child's authentic process of discovery, whether through quiet insight, excitement, or serious realization.

**Length:** 3-8 lines

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

Regulated and committed, the character begins the final attempt, demonstrating growth and the new solution through their actions.

**Psychology:**
- Initiates the attempt independently (agency).
- Demonstrates learned coping strategies in action.
- Shows visible growth in approach and emotional control.

**Engagement:** High energy building to a climax for external problems, or quiet determination for internal ones. The character's new competence or grace should be visible, creating a sense of impending triumph.

**Length:** 2-5 lines

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback

The attempt is almost successful when a minor, non-catastrophic problem occurs (e.g., a tower wobbles), triggering the memory of earlier core incident or low point and creating suspense.

**Psychology:** Pure action and suspense.

**Engagement:** Maximum tension. A breath-holding moment as the outcome hangs in the balance.

**Length:** 2-5 lines

### Beat 4.3: Persistence

Facing the setback, the character feels old negative emotion rise, but consciously uses the learned skill (e.g., takes a deep breath) to self-regulate. Then performs the small, careful action required to 
fix the setback.

**Psychology:**
- Consciously uses coping strategies to overcome the internal hurdle.
- Solves the problem through their own decisive action, proving growth (agency).
- Support should be minimal (e.g., Partnership Language, Success Setup).

**Engagement:** The peak moment of triumphant breakthrough. The action should feel surprising yet inevitable, showing the character's earned growth. A co-regulated success should feel warm and empowering.

**Length:** 3-6 lines

### Beat 4.4: Success

The problem is clearly resolved by the character's action. This can be achieving a goal, reaching a new behavioral state (e.g., falling asleep peacefully), or finishing a task.

**Psychology:** The triumph belongs to the child (agency), even if supported.

**Engagement:** A clear and satisfying release of tension. Vivid image of what success looks like. The beat concludes right on that image, all reward goes into the next one.

**Length:** 2-5 lines

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief

An immediate positive emotional release and consequence follows success. The "reward" can be a tangible item, praise, or the direct positive outcome. Show physical joy/relief, followed by a calm satisfaction.

**Psychology:**
- Show physical joy/relief first, then a brief positive emotion label.
- The positive consequence is experienced directly.
- Praise, if given, must be specific and process-focused.
- The character drives and enjoys their success (agency).

**Engagement:** Emotional payoff. The celebration should feel genuine, ranging from exuberant joy to quiet awe. Readers should feel the character's satisfaction. A good place to use fun phrases 
that make the child laugh.

**Length:** 4-6 lines

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning

Tension fully subsides as the character processes the success, realizing the meaning of their experience in simple, concrete terms. Show understanding through expression or action with simple, concrete lesson. Learning can be named simply.

**Psychology:**
- The child owns the realization (agency).
- Support should be brief (Active Listening, Gentle Questions, Process Praise).
- Frame learning as development, not a fixed trait.
- The understanding is a discovery, not a lecture.

**Engagement:** A warm, calming, and satisfying feeling. The child's realization is expressed in their unique, authentic way.

**Length:** 1-3 lines

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo

The character's situation is transformed. This is shown through an integrated action: making amends, teaching the skill to a toy, helping someone, or confidently using the new ability. This demonstrates the new, more capable status quo. Ends with a scene depicting everything being good again.

**Psychology:**
- The child initiates the action, showing agency and embodied growth.
- Support should be minimal and only if necessary.
- Show the positive impact of the changed behavior, do not explain it.
- Depict the integration and transformation as a natural progression in the character's development.

**Engagement:** A satisfying resolution that contrasts with the opening. The integrated action is heartwarming, and the character's new confidence shines through their ordinary actions, showing genuine growth.

**Length:** 4-8 lines

### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought

A brief, punchy, and resonant emotional closure. The final image, action, or concise thought should speak for itself, hinting that the skill is truly internalized.

**Psychology:** Pure emotional closure.

**Engagement:** A warm, lingering ending that captures something essential about the character or their journey. A simple 
statement, a characteristic gesture, or a forward-looking question can 
provide a perfect, satisfying end note.

**Length:** 1-3 lines

## Prose Style & Formatting Guide

This guide provides unified style and formatting rules for writing children's stories for 4-5 year olds in both English and Russian.

### **1. Core Principles**

*   **Show, Don't Tell**: Describe actions to imply emotion.
    *   **Instead of**: "Liska was curious."
    *   **Write**: "Liska tilted her head. Her ears twitched."
*   **Conversational character**: Write as if a person is telling the story orally.
*   **Use age-approptiate language** for 5-6 year olds that parents speaking to children, or children speaking to each other, would use. Do not use awkward phrases, make it flow.
*   **Include connecting words** that facilitate smooth spoken delivery.
*   **Natural storytelling flow**: Use transitions and phrases that sound natural when spoken aloud.
*   **Rhythmic quality**: Ensure sentences have a pleasant cadence for parent-child reading sessions.
*   **Tense & Person**: Write exclusively in the 3rd person, past tense.

### **2. Document & Page Structure**

*   **Target Audience**: 4-5 year old children (language complexity for 5-year-olds).
*   **Total Text Length**: 500-700 words maximum.
*   **Page/Line Word Count**: 15-30 words.
*   **Page/Line Sentence Count**: 2-4 sentences.
*   **Format**: Each line of text in the draft represents one page. Do not use page numbers. Insert an empty line between each line/page.

#### **Example (Line Split Format)**

This shows how to correctly split output into multiple lines. Each line represents a "page" in a picture book.

**CORRECT:**
> Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam. She pressed low to the ground. Her bottom gave a little wiggle and...
>
> She pounced like a tiny predator! But her paw only patted the floor with a little *fump*. Liska furrowed her brows in confusion.

**INCORRECT:**
> Tonight, Liska was hunting a moonbeam.
> She pressed low to the ground.
> Her bottom gave a little wiggle and...
> She pounced like a tiny predator!
> But her paw only patted the floor with a little *fump*.
> Liska furrowed her brows in confusion.

### **2.1 Forbidden Tropes**

Never include these elements in any story:

*   **Adult lectures or "teaching conversations"**: No scenes where adults explain emotions, concepts, or lessons for more than 1-2 sentences.
*   **Magic solutions or instant emotional fixes**: All emotional regulation must be realistic and require effort from the child.
*   **Passive protagonists**: The child must never simply be told the lesson or have problems solved for them by adults.
*   **Static scenes**: Every scene must advance the plot or develop character—no pauses for pure exposition.
*   **Didactic dialogue**: Characters should never speak primarily to convey a lesson to the reader.
*   **Premature problem resolution**: Avoid resolving emotional tension too quickly with adult intervention.

### **3. Sentence & Vocabulary**

*   **Age-Appropriate Language**: All vocabulary must be simple and common for 4-5 year olds. When a complex concept is necessary, it must be explained through simple actions or dialogue. Avoid abstract nouns and complex sentence structures.
*   **Rhythmic Flow**: Vary sentence length to create a natural, pleasant cadence. Avoid choppy sentences.
    *   **Instead of**: "Liska was confused. She tilted her head."
    *   **Write**: "Liska tilted her head in confusion."
*   **Connecting Words**: Use simple connectors (e.g., "And," "But," "So," "Then") to create a smooth, flowing narrative.
*   **Simple Vocabulary**: Prioritize common nouns and verbs that a 5-year-old can easily understand.
*   **Adjective Rule**: Use only simple, concrete adjectives. Avoid abstract or multi-syllabic words.
    *   **Use**: `big`, `soft`, `happy`, `little`, `red`, `warm`.
    *   **Avoid**: `tremendous`, `ethereal`, `melancholy`, `minuscule`, `crimson`, `tepid`.
*   **Pacing Rule**: Maximum 2 consecutive paragraphs without tension, humor, or character action. Edit for conciseness, cut anything that slows the pace.

### **3.1 Voice Guidelines for 4-6 Year Old Storybooks**

Use 90% active voice in the text

Use 10% passive voice for the following situations:
- Mystery/suspense - when hiding the actor creates intrigue ("The cookies were stolen!")
- Character focus - when emphasizing what happens to someone matters more than who does it ("The princess was rescued")
- Unknown actors - when the doer is unclear or irrelevant to the story ("The door was opened")
- Gentle tone - when softening blame or consequences ("The toy was broken")
- Atmosphere building - when setting mood is more important than specific actions ("The forest was filled with magical sounds")
- Historical context - when describing past events where the actor is less important ("The castle was built long ago")

### **3.2 Vocabulary Development**

*   **Advanced Word Allocation**: 3-5% of total words can be slightly more complex than typical 4-5 year old vocabulary. This equals approximately 1 advanced word per 1-2 pages.
*   **Selection Criteria**: Choose words that:
    *   Expand emotional or sensory vocabulary meaningfully
    *   Are easily understood through context or visual illustration
    *   Connect to the story's core themes or character development
    *   Sound appealing when read aloud
*   **Integration Method**: Advanced words must be:
    *   Surrounded by familiar language for context support
    *   Reinforced through character actions or illustrations
    *   Used naturally within the narrative flow, never forced
*   **Examples of Appropriate Advanced Words**:
    *   **Emotional**: "bewildered," "determined," "anxious"
    *   **Sensory**: "glistening," "velvety," "melodic"
    *   **Descriptive**: "enormous," "miniature," "peculiar"
    *   **Action**: "whispered," "scurried," "emerged"

### **4. Literary Devices**

*   **Story Titles**: Must be descriptive, specific, and memorable. They should convey both meaning and a specific situation.
    *   **EN Example**:
        *   Good: "Liska Saves for a Kebab"
        *   Bad: "Liska Learns To Save Money"
    *   **RU Example**:
        *   Good: "Лиска копит на шашлычок"
        *   Bad: "Лиска учится копить деньги"
*   **Metaphors and Images**: Must be simple, visual, and immediately understandable. They must be adapted to maintain emotional impact and cultural resonance for each target language.
*   **Refrains and Repeated Phrases**: Must be memorable, emotionally resonant, and easy for a child to chant.
    *   **EN Example**: "Afraid, but trying."
    *   **RU Example**: "Боюсь, но пробую"

### **5. Cultural Adaptation**
*   **Names and Cultural Elements**: Adapt concepts to natural Russian equivalents (e.g., "Meat pastry" → "чебурек").
*   **Refrains and Repeated Phrases**: Adapt refrains to be memorable and emotionally evocative in Russian (e.g., "From Purr to Growl" → "Мурчалки-рычалки").

### **5.1 Emotion Metaphors & Co-regulation Rules**

*   **Metaphor Limits**: Stories must contain exactly 1-2 emotion metaphors maximum.
    *   Metaphors must be introduced by adult characters first
    *   They should be simple, visual, and immediately understandable to a 5-year-old
    *   Integrate metaphors into action, not as explanatory tools
*   **Co-regulation Constraints**:
    *   Maximum 3 exchanges between child and adult during any co-regulation moment
    *   Must be physical-first (hugs, positioning, touch) before verbal
    *   Embedded in action—no stopping the plot for emotional processing
    *   During high-tension moments, co-regulation must be minimal (a glance, a soft word) to avoid premature conflict resolution
*   **Emotion Sequencing**: Always follow "Show and Label" principle
    *   First: Physical manifestation (tears, clenched fists, tight shoulders)
    *   Then: Brief labeling if needed ("That's frustration making your body tight")
    *   Never reverse this order

### **6. Dialogue Formatting**

#### **English**

*   Enclose dialogue in double quotation marks (`"`).
*   Place punctuation like commas, periods, and question marks **inside** the closing quotation mark.
*   **Correct Example**:
    ```
    "Let's build a fort," said Liska.

    "Okay!" squeaked Anji. "I'll get the blankets."
    ```

#### **Russian**

*   Use an em-dash (`—`) to introduce dialogue. Do not use quotation marks (`«»` or `""`).
*   **Correct Example**:
    ```
    — Давай построим форт, — сказал Лиска.

    — Хорошо! — пискнула Анжи. — Я принесу одеяла.
    ```

### **7. Flagging for Review**

**Mark in bold** any passages that are difficult to write while adhering to all rules. This allows for an editorial decision. Flag passages that involve:

*   Cultural concepts that may not be universally understood or easily translated.
*   Wordplay or puns that are difficult to execute with simple language.
*   Complex emotional states that are hard to convey through simple actions ("show, don't tell").
*   Abstract concepts that resist simplification.
