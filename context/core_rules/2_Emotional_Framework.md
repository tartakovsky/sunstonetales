## Emotional Metaphor System

This system provides consistent metaphors to represent emotions, designed to be thematically consistent (natural & geological), somatically accurate (matching physical sensations), and pedagogically sound.

---

### 1. Anger -> Dragon Inside (Внутри проснулся дракон)

How it feels:

-   Hot all over - burning face, hot ears, heat spreading through the body
-   Whole body gets tight and rigid - every muscle clenches at once
-   Shaking/trembling with the intensity of the feeling
-   Heart pounding so hard they can feel it everywhere
-   Can't breathe properly - chest too tight, throat closing
-   Energy surging through arms and legs - wanting to hit, kick, throw, destroy
-   Everything buzzes/vibrates with intensity inside
-   Feel like they're going to EXPLODE from the pressure
-   Can't think clearly - just pure physical sensation taking over
-   Overwhelming urge to MOVE - run, stomp, break things

Narrative Example:

> (And then Liska remembered how her mom hugged her, and a warm Kitten started to purr in her chest. It warmed her from the inside, and her lips stretched into a smile all on their own.)

---

### 3. Sadness (Heaviness & Tears) → Rainy Cloud (Дождливая Тучка)

---

### 6. Lingering Resentment → Embers (Угольки)

How it feels:

-   Can't stop thinking about what they did

-   Keep remembering and getting angry again
-   Don't want to forgive them

Distinction from Prickly Hedgehog: While the Hedgehog is a vulnerable, defensive hurt from a situation, Embers are a hot, directed lingering resentment toward a person.

Narrative Example:

> Лиска чувствовала, как будто внутри неё тлеют маленькие горячие угольки. Каждый раз, когда она их видела, она снова злилась. Ей больше не хотелось с ними играть. Она всем рассказывала, что они сделали неправильно. Она хотела, чтобы они извинились, но знала, что они этого не сделают.

---

### 7. Self-pitying Hurt -> Prickly Hedgehog (Колючий Ёжик)

How it feels:

-   Feel sorry for yourself

-   Don't want to do anything fun
-   Sitting with arms crossed, turned away
-   Waiting for someone to notice you're upset
-   Feel like the world is against you
-   "Why does this always happen to me?"

Distinction from Embers: While `Embers` represent lingering resentment towards another person, the `Prickly Hedgehog` represents the more vulnerable, self-pitying `обида` that comes from situational disappointment (e.g., a toy breaking, a plan being cancelled, a comfort becoming a source of pain). It's a defensive posture against the world's unfairness, not a grudge against a person.

Narrative Example:

> Вместо тёплого мурчания в груди свернулся в клубок колючий, обиженный Ёжик.

> (The warm purr disappeared, and instead, a prickly, hurt Hedgehog curled up in her chest.)

---

-   Feel like everyone is staring at you
-   Voice disappears, can't talk

-   Feel like the worst person ever
-   Want to disappear completely

Narrative Example:
> Liska's face burned hot. It felt like she did something wrong and every single person had stopped to turn and look right at her. She wanted to dig a hole and hide in it forever.

---

### 9. Resolution for Shame → A Warm Hug

How it feels:

-   The sick feeling slowly goes away

-   Safe feeling comes back

Narrative Example:
> Her face was hot. But her friend smiled, and she felt like she received a warm, soft hug from her mother. The bad feeling disappeared, and she felt soft and happy inside. She knew mistakes were okay and smiled back.

> Её лицо горело. Но её друг улыбнулся в ответ и она почувствовала, как будто её мягко и тепло обняла мама. Неприятное чувство исчезло, и она почувствовала себя мягкой и счастливой внутри. Она поняла, что ошибаться - это нормально, и улыбнулась в ответ.

> (Liska tried again, but again she failed. She felt herself deflating like a balloon. Whoosh... - all her confidence and energy went out, and she was left lying on the floor a soft, helpless little lump. "I can't," she whispered.)

> (Liska wanted to build a bridge. Anji said to put the heavy stone on the bottom, but the Kebab Man said it should go on top. The thoughts in Liska's head got mixed up, like threads in a Tangled Yarn. She didn't know who was right, and this made her feel anxious and lost.)

> (Liska was so excited to go to the park. She thought about how fun it would be. But then Mom said, "We can't go, it's started to rain heavily." Liska felt everything inside her shrink and droop, like a flower that suddenly wilted. Now nothing sounded good anymore.)

### 18. Temptation (Irresistible Pull) → Magnetic Rock (Магнитный Камень)

How it feels:

-   Want it SO BAD right now
-   Keep staring at it, can't look away
-   Hands move toward it without permission
-   "Just one little touch" in your head
-   Know you shouldn't but want to anyway
-   Getting harder to be good each second
-   Feel sneaky thoughts starting
-   Body won't stay still
-   Keep thinking of reasons why it's okay
-   "Maybe no one will know"
-   The wanting gets bigger and bigger

Causal Link: Occurs when an immediate, desirable object or action captures attention, creating a strong pull in conflict with rules or delayed gratification.

Narrative Example:

> Лиска увидела блестящую игрушку на столе. Её не разрешали трогать, её лапки как магнитом тянуло к игрушке. Ей так хотелось схватить её прямо сейчас, что всё тело зудело от желания.

> (Liska saw a shiny toy on the table. She wasn't allowed to touch it, pulling her paws like a magnet toward the toy. She wanted to grab it right now so badly that her whole body itched with desire.)

### 19. Envy (Coping by Devaluation) → Sour Grapes (Кислый Виноград)

How it feels:

-   Really want what they have
-   Not fair that they got it and you didn't
-   Start thinking mean things about their thing
-   "Mine is better anyway" but know it's not true
-   Want to say something mean about it
-   Pretend you don't care but you really do
-   Feel mad at them for having it
-   Try to find what's wrong with their thing
-   Wish something bad would happen to it
-   Can't be happy for them at all
-   Keep looking at it even though it hurts

Causal Link: Follows seeing someone else have or achieve something you desperately want. It's a coping mechanism for the feeling of envy.

Narrative Example:

> У Анжи появились новые красные сапожки. Лиске так сильно захотелось такие же, что во рту стало кисло. "Пф-ф," - фыркнула она. - "Наверное, они жмут. Мои лапки и без них быстрее бегают".

> (Anji got new red boots. Liska wanted a pair so badly her mouth turned sour. "Pfft," she snorted. "They probably pinch. My own paws can run faster without them.")

## Emotion Unfolding Sequence

This section outlines the four-step process for how emotions manifest in a character, based on their specific emotion description above.

1. Physical Expression:
   - Describe the external expression or physical manifestation of the emotion. This should be a recognizable signal that others can observe.
   - Example: "Liska's fists clenched tightly, and a low growl escaped her lips."

2. Internal Feeling:
   - Detail the internal sensations and feelings associated with the emotion. This should align with the character's personal experience of the emotion.
   - Example: "A hot, prickly sensation spread through her chest, making her feel tense and warm."

3. Automatic Coping:
   - Identify the immediate, instinctive actions taken to cope with the emotion. These actions should be realistic and relatable, reflecting a natural response.
   - Example: "She turned away, hiding her face in her paws to shield herself from others."

4. Learned Coping:
   - Outline the learned strategies or behaviors used to manage the emotion. These should be constructive and modeled on desirable coping mechanisms taught to the character.
   - Example: "She took a deep breath and counted to five, remembering her mother's advice to calm down."
