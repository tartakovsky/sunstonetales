# 2. Emotional Framework

This document is an encyclopedia of emotions for the story world, covering how they feel, useful metaphors, and behavioral unfolding.

## Emotional Metaphor System

This system provides consistent metaphors to represent emotions, designed to be thematically consistent (natural & geological), somatically accurate (matching physical sensations), and pedagogically sound.

### 1. Anger -> Dragon Inside (Внутри проснулся дракон)

How it feels:

-   Hot all over - burning face, hot ears, heat spreading through the body
-   Whole body gets tight and rigid - every muscle clenches at once
-   Shaking/trembling with the intensity of the feeling
-   Heart pounding so hard they can feel it everywhere
-   Can't breathe properly - chest too tight, throat closing
-   Energy surging through arms and legs - wanting to hit, kick, throw, destroy
-   Everything buzzes/vibrates with intensity inside
-   Feel like they're going to EXPLODE from the pressure
-   Can't think clearly - just pure physical sensation taking over
-   Overwhelming urge to MOVE - run, stomp, break things

Narrative Example:
> It was like a little dragon woke up inside Liska. Her face got hot, her fists clenched, and her heart beat really fast. She felt like she had to stomp and shout because the dragon wanted to get out.

> Внутри Лиски проснулся маленький дракон. Её лицо стало горячим, кулачки сжались, а сердце забилось очень быстро. Она хотела топать и кричать, как будто дракон хотел вылететь наружу.

> (And then Liska remembered how her mom hugged her, and a warm Kitten started to purr in her chest. It warmed her from the inside, and her lips stretched into a smile all on their own.)

---

### 3. Sadness (Heaviness & Tears) → Rainy Cloud (Дождливая Тучка)

---

### 6. Lingering Resentment → Embers (Угольки)

How it feels:

-   Can't stop thinking about what they did
-   Every time you see them, get mad all over again
-   Don't want to play with them anymore
-   Keep telling everyone what they did wrong

-   Keep remembering and getting angry again
-   Don't want to forgive them
-   Everything they have seems unfair

Distinction from Prickly Hedgehog: While the Hedgehog is a vulnerable, defensive hurt from a situation, Embers are a hot, directed lingering resentment toward a person.

Narrative Example:

> Лиска чувствовала, как будто внутри неё тлеют маленькие горячие угольки. Каждый раз, когда она их видела, она снова злилась. Ей больше не хотелось с ними играть. Она всем рассказывала, что они сделали неправильно. Она хотела, чтобы они извинились, но знала, что они этого не сделают.

> Liska felt like little hot embers were inside her. They made her mad every time she saw them. She didn't want to play with them anymore. She kept telling everyone what they did wrong. She wished they would say sorry but knew they wouldn't.

### 7. Self-pitying Hurt -> Prickly Hedgehog (Колючий Ёжик)

How it feels:

-   Feel sorry for yourself
-   Want to be alone but also want someone to care
-   Nothing anyone says makes it better
-   "Nobody understands" feeling
-   Want to cry but holding it in
-   Everything seems mean and unfair
-   Don't want to do anything fun
-   Sitting with arms crossed, turned away
-   Waiting for someone to notice you're upset
-   Feel like the world is against you
-   "Why does this always happen to me?"

Distinction from Embers: While `Embers` represent lingering resentment towards another person, the `Prickly Hedgehog` represents the more vulnerable, self-pitying `обида` that comes from situational disappointment (e.g., a toy breaking, a plan being cancelled, a comfort becoming a source of pain). It's a defensive posture against the world's unfairness, not a grudge against a person.

Narrative Example:

> Вместо тёплого мурчания в груди свернулся в клубок колючий, обиженный Ёжик.

> (The warm purr disappeared, and instead, a prickly, hurt Hedgehog curled up in her chest.)

> Её лицо горело. Но её друг улыбнулся в ответ и она почувствовала, как будто её мягко и тепло обняла мама. Неприятное чувство исчезло, и она почувствовала себя мягкой и счастливой внутри. Она поняла, что ошибаться - это нормально, и улыбнулась в ответ.

> (Liska wanted to build a bridge. Anji said to put the heavy stone on the bottom, but the Kebab Man said it should go on top. The thoughts in Liska's head got mixed up, like threads in a Tangled Yarn. She didn't know who was right, and this made her feel anxious and lost.)

## Emotion Unfolding Sequence

This section outlines the four-step process for how emotions manifest in a character, based on their specific emotion description above.

1. Physical Expression:
   - Describe the external expression or physical manifestation of the emotion. This should be a recognizable signal that others can observe.
   - Example: "Liska's fists clenched tightly, and a low growl escaped her lips."

2. Internal Feeling:
   - Detail the internal sensations and feelings associated with the emotion. This should align with the character's personal experience of the emotion.
   - Example: "A hot, prickly sensation spread through her chest, making her feel tense and warm."

3. Automatic Coping:
   - Identify the immediate, instinctive actions taken to cope with the emotion. These actions should be realistic and relatable, reflecting a natural response.
   - Example: "She turned away, hiding her face in her paws to shield herself from others."

4. Learned Coping:
   - Outline the learned strategies or behaviors used to manage the emotion. These should be constructive and modeled on desirable coping mechanisms taught to the character.
   - Example: "She took a deep breath and counted to five, remembering her mother's advice to calm down."
