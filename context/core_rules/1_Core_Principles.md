## Storytelling Guidelines

These are the general narrative rules for creating stories.

---

### **Characters for 5-year-olds**

- Child-like characters or small creatures they can identify with
- Characters with very distinct visual and personality traits
- Animal characters or fantastical creatures with human-like qualities
- Characters that show emotions clearly
- Heroes who are clever, kind, or brave in age-appropriate ways
- "Villains" who are more misunderstood than evil - redeemable
- Include diverse characters but don't make their diversity the focus of the story

### **Plot structures/tension**

- Simple problem-solution arcs
- Tension should be mild - lost items, minor conflicts, misunderstandings, minor external dangers
- No life-threatening situations generally
- Physical humor and silly situations work well
- Moments of mild suspense followed quickly by relief
- Plots about friendship, helping others, understanding differences, overcoming fears, learning new skills, the joy of discovery

### **Morals**

- Simple, clear lessons but not preachy
- Emphasis on kindness, friendship, honesty, courage, trying again after failure
- Showing consequences of actions (natural consequences, not punishments)
- Celebrating differences
- The importance of asking for help
- Managing emotions

### **Keeping attention/tension resolution**

- Use different voices for characters
- Include moments where the child can participate or predict what happens next
- Questions within the narrative like "What do you think will happen?"
- Small cliffhangers between story segments
- Clear resolution for each story problem
- End on a positive, comforting note

<!-- the story that was most praised for it's metaphors is the most boring story I wrote. Do we even want the metaphors?  -->
### **Emotion Metaphors**
- Introduce at least one, at most two, in each story.
- One for main problematic emotion
- Maybe one for target positive emotion
- After the metaphor state explicitely what emotion it represents
- Never more than two, one for problematic emotion and one leading to solution
- Introduction of the metaphor should either be done explicitely by the parent before the child can use it
- Or the metaphor should be natural enough to narrate it for the reader, while the character themselves doesn't voice it.
- Never the child comes up themselves with the metaphor and says it first

### **Coping Strategy Introduction**
- Make sure that before we use a learned coping strategy, it is either
  - Introduced explicitely by a parent and preferably practiced before the child can apply it by themselves
  - Or if the child is alone, it is very well justified that they can somehow apply something reasonable while being dysregulated. That would typically require them to just live through emotional spike. Then when they can think it should be something extremely trivial that leads them to a coping strategy / solution.
