# 1. Core Principles

This document contains the foundational developmental and storytelling principles for the project.

---

## Developmental Guidelines


These guidelines are based on psychological principles to ensure the stories are beneficial and supportive for a young audience.

---

### **Rule: Process Praise instead of Personal Praise**

*   **Goal:** Fostering Mindset & Competence
*   **Description:** Focus on effort, strategy, and process, not fixed traits.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "You're so smart," write "You found a very good way to solve that."

---

### **Rule: Growth Language instead of Fixed Language**

*   **Goal:** Fostering Mindset & Competence
*   **Description:** Frame abilities as learnable, not innate.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "She can't do it," write "She hasn't learned how to do it yet."

---

### **Rule: Specific Feedback instead of Generic Praise**

*   **Goal:** Fostering Mindset & Competence
*   **Description:** Pinpoint what the child did well to reinforce positive behaviors.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "Good job," write "You were very patient while you waited your turn."

---

### **Rule: Co-regulation instead of Self-regulation**

*   **Goal:** Building Emotional Intelligence
*   **Description:** Show an adult providing a calm presence before introducing coping tools.
*   **Example:** Show a parent calmly hugging a child until they are calm, and only then suggest, "Let's take a deep breath together."

---

### **Rule: Emotion Validation instead of Emotion Dismissal**

*   **Goal:** Building Emotional Intelligence
*   **Description:** Treat all feelings as valid and acceptable.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "Don't be sad," write "It's okay to feel sad. It's disappointing when your tower falls."

---

### **Rule: Clear Labels instead of Vague Emotions**

*   **Goal:** Building Emotional Intelligence
*   **Description:** Help build emotional vocabulary by naming specific feelings.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "He felt bad," write "He felt frustrated and a little bit lonely."

---

### **Rule: Child Agency instead of Adult Solutions**

*   **Goal:** Promoting Agency & Problem-Solving
*   **Description:** Show adults as guides who help children think, not as heroes who fix everything.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "Papa fixed the toy for her," write "Papa helped her figure out how the pieces fit together."

---

### **Rule: Child Choice instead of Adult Control**

*   **Goal:** Promoting Agency & Problem-Solving
*   **Description:** Provide opportunities for the character to make simple, meaningful decisions.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "Mama made him wear his red boots," write "He chose to wear his red boots to jump in puddles."

---

### **Rule: Process Focus instead of Magical Solutions**

*   **Goal:** Promoting Agency & Problem-Solving
*   **Description:** Show the child working through challenges step by step rather than using magic to instantly solve problems.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "She waved her wand and fixed everything," write "She tried different ways to stack the blocks until she found one that worked."

---

### **Rule: Natural Consequences instead of Punishment**

*   **Goal:** Developing Social Skills & Empathy
*   **Description:** Show that outcomes are a direct result of actions.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "She got in trouble for yelling," write "When she yelled, her friend felt sad and didn't want to play."

---

### **Rule: Perspective-Taking instead of Missing Empathy**

*   **Goal:** Developing Social Skills & Empathy
*   **Description:** Explicitly include moments where a character wonders about another's feelings.
*   **Example:** Add moments like, "Liska wondered why her brother was so quiet. Maybe he was feeling tired?"

---

### **Rule: Learning Frame instead of Shame Language**

*   **Goal:** Developing Social Skills & Empathy
*   **Description:** Frame mistakes as discoveries, not failures.
*   **Example:** Instead of writing "That was a big mistake," write "She discovered that putting too much water makes the paint runny."

## Storytelling Guidelines

These are the general narrative rules for creating stories.

---

### **Characters for 5-year-olds**

- Child-like characters or small creatures they can identify with
- Characters with very distinct visual and personality traits
- Animal characters or fantastical creatures with human-like qualities
- Characters that show emotions clearly
- Heroes who are clever, kind, or brave in age-appropriate ways
- "Villains" who are more misunderstood than evil - redeemable
- Include diverse characters but don't make their diversity the focus of the story

### **Plot structures/tension**

- Simple problem-solution arcs
- Tension should be mild - lost items, minor conflicts, misunderstandings
- No life-threatening situations generally
- Physical humor and silly situations work well
- Moments of mild suspense followed quickly by relief
- Plots about friendship, helping others, understanding differences, overcoming fears, learning new skills, the joy of discovery

### **Morals**

- Simple, clear lessons but not preachy
- Emphasis on kindness, friendship, honesty, courage, trying again after failure
- Showing consequences of actions (natural consequences, not punishments)
- Celebrating differences
- The importance of asking for help
- Managing emotions

### **Keeping attention/tension resolution**

- Use different voices for characters
- Include moments where the child can participate or predict what happens next
- Questions within the narrative like "What do you think will happen?"
- Small cliffhangers between story segments
- Clear resolution for each story problem
- End on a positive, comforting note
- Consider including small illustrations

### **Emotion Metaphors**
- Introduce at least one, at most two, in each story.
- One for main problematic emotion
- Maybe one for target positive emotion
- After the metaphor state explicitely what emotion it represents
- Never more than two, one for problematic emotion and one leading to solution
- Introduction of the metaphor should either be done explicitely by the parent before the child can use it
- Or the metaphor should be natural enough to narrate it for the reader, while the character themselves doesn't voice it.
- Never the child comes up themselves with the metaphor and says it first

### **Coping Strategy Introduction**
- Make sure that before we use a learned coping strategy, it is either
  - Introduced explicitely by a parent and preferably practiced before the child can apply it by themselves
  - Or if the child is alone, it is very well justified that they can somehow apply something reasonable while being dysregulated. That would typically require them to just live through emotional spike. Then when they can think it should be something extremely trivial that leads them to a coping strategy / solution.
