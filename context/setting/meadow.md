## Narrative Description (for Writers)

Imagine that the private, walled backyard garden has a *second* gate at its far end—a simple, arched gate of weathered brick or sandstone. This gate does not open onto a city street, but onto a wide, grassy clearing that slopes gently towards the jungle's edge.

This is the Communal Green. It is not a manicured public park, but a semi-wild meadow shared by the handful of houses whose garden walls back onto it. The grass is soft and sun-bleached, dotted with a few lone palm trees and hardy tropical shrubs. It's a place where a child can set up a small wooden table to draw, feeling the freedom of an open field while still being just steps from the safety of her own garden gate. In the distance, the dense wall of the jungle is visible, and the sound of the nearby sea is carried on the warm, orange-hued evening breeze.

**Key Details to Include:**
- **The Transition:** The arched gate is the crucial element. It's the portal between the private, controlled garden and this larger, freer space
- **Landscape:** A sun-bleached, grassy clearing, not a perfect lawn. It should feel natural and a bit untamed, with lone palms and shrubs
- **Boundaries:** It is bordered on one side by the sandstone garden walls of several homes and on the other by the edge of the jungle. It is semi-enclosed and feels safe
- **Atmosphere:** A feeling of intimate freedom. It's a personal slice of the wild, safe enough for a child to play alone. The warm, golden light of sunset is particularly important here
- **Ownership:** It is a semi-private space, belonging to a small community of neighbors. This reinforces the communal values of the culture
