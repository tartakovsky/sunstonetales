## Narrative Description (for Writers)

Semi-wild meadow shared by handful of neighboring families. Accessed through second gate from private gardens - the portal between controlled domestic space and freer natural area. 

**Atmosphere:** Intimate freedom. Safe enough for solitary child play while feeling untamed. Sound of distant sea carried on evening breeze.

**Function:** Semi-private communal space reinforcing neighborhood values. Place for children to experience independence within safety.
