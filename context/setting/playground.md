## Narrative Description (for Writers)

This is an informal, lively childcare space, located either in a shaded neighborhood courtyard or a large, open-walled room on the ground floor of a residential building. It is a scene of organized chaos, where a volunteer caregiver oversees a mixed-age group of young, cat-like kits. The air is filled with the sounds of storytelling, with older children teaching younger ones simple songs or observational games. Learning happens through play and peer-to-peer sharing, not formal lessons, creating an atmosphere that is energetic, chaotic, but safe.
