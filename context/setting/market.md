## Narrative Description (for Writers)

The neighborhood market fills a sun-drenched open plaza, bordered by the golden sandstone walls of residential buildings. Instead of a maze of alleys, the space is organized around freestanding stalls built from rich tropical hardwoods. A patchwork of colorful canvas awnings is stretched between the stalls and nearby carved-wood balconies, creating shifting patterns of light and shade on the stone pavers below. The air is thick and humid, a lively mix of scents—cinnamon and cardamom from spice merchants, savory smoke from a food vendor grilling meat, and the sweet, damp smell of exotic fruits and flowers brought in from the jungle. The cat-like inhabitants gather here, their animated, expressive voices creating a constant, energetic hum as they socialize and trade.
