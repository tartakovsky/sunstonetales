## Narrative Description (for Writers)

Liska's private refuge mirrors the home's rounded architecture but scaled for a child. The sleeping corner occupies one curved wall, defined by layers of thick, colorful woven rugs and an assortment of plush cushions - no formal bed, following the family's floor-sleeping tradition. 

The opposite corner serves as her play space, with low wooden shelves holding carved animals and simple toys. A low table sits near the arched window - chest-high when seated on floor cushions - where she draws. The window can be opened to the garden or closed with wooden shutters inlaid with latticework and colored glass panels that cast jewel-toned light patterns.

A large monstera plant fills one corner, its broad split leaves creating natural hiding spots and adding to the room's organic feel. A single oil lamp in a wall niche provides warm evening light, casting gentle shadows that dance across the curved walls and through the plant's dramatic foliage. The space feels contained and protective - a perfect sanctuary for a young kit to retreat, play, and rest.
