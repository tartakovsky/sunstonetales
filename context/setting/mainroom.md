## Narrative Description (for Writers)

The family's private heart - a space reserved for intimate gatherings, meals, and conversation. This is where the cat-like family comes together to share food from low tables while seated on floor cushions, following their cultural dining traditions.

The room feels protected and exclusive, accessible only through the foyer where guests typically proceed directly to the rooftop. Wall niches hold treasured objects and oil lamps that create warm pools of light for evening family time. Built-in shelves store household items and personal belongings, making this the true center of family life.
