## Narrative Description (for Writers)

**Core Concept:**
The Saar is a self-contained, secure micro-community. It functions as a "safe container" for its residents, particularly the children. It is the transitional space between the private safety of the home and the public world outside its gates.

**Physical Layout:**
- **Structure:** A ring of 10-12 multi-story houses arranged in a rough, many-sided circle. The houses face inward, their doors and windows opening onto the central Yard
- **The Yard:** The large, communal space at the center. It is primarily covered in grass, with a network of worn stone paths connecting the houses and the gates. Several large, broad-leafed trees provide significant shade, creating a cool, dappled environment
- **Liska's Home:** Positioned on the eastern side of the Saar, between the Jungle Gate and the Sea Gate
- **The Gates:** Three distinct, archway-style gates serve as the only exits:
  - **Market Gate (West):** Faces the main settlement and its bustling market. Source of noise, crowds, and smells of commerce and cooked food
  - **Jungle Gate (Northeast):** Faces a meadow that leads to the dense jungle. Carries scent of grass and wildflowers, and deeper forest sounds
  - **Sea Gate (Southeast):** Faces the beach and open water. Source of sea spray, wave sounds, and salt smell

**Atmosphere & Sensory Palette:**
- **Feeling:** Sheltered, communal, and safe. Constant, low-level hum of community life: children playing, neighbors calling, sounds of crafts or chores
- **Light & Temperature:** Dense tree canopy creates cool, shaded interior offering respite from external heat. Light is often dappled and soft
- **Sounds:** Mix of internal community sounds layered with distinct sounds from each gate: commerce chatter (Market), insect hum (Jungle), rhythmic waves (Sea)
- **Smells:** Blend of cooking food and spices (Market Gate), damp earth and vegetation (Jungle Gate), and sea salt (Sea Gate)

**Narrative Function:**
- **Controlled Environment:** Enclosed nature makes it believable for young child's "solo" journey while never truly in danger
- **Passive Supervision:** Inward-facing houses create collective watchfulness—any Yard event is implicitly witnessed
- **Scalable World:** For adults it's small; for Liska, journey from doorstep to center is epic expedition
- **Staging Area:** Perfect location for evening events like bonfires or puppet shows in center
