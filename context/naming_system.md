# The Naming System

The system uses two primary formats, chosen based on the story's core conflict:


1. The "How" Story:
    * Format: How Liska [Action/State]...
    * Purpose: Used for stories focused on a process or a common internal state. It frames the
        story as a retrospective account, which is useful for directly and safely connecting with
        a child's own feelings (e.g., fear) or explaining a process (e.g., saving).


2. The "Adventure/Encounter" Story:
    * Format: Liska and the [Noun Phrase]
    * Purpose: Used to frame a problem as a memorable, external "thing" or event. This format
        is often more playful and reframes a challenge as an adventure.
