Names for the system interfaces: 
- Arbiter
- Shaper

are they the same, or the Arbiter is more omnipresent controller forcing messages and judgements and Shaper is actual places that can measure and influence bodies?


The debate here is whether I want the system to be obvious, like in litRPG where it rewards things and gives you an interface. On the other hand, it can be like the progression fantasy where there is no numbers at all. In between it can be like a tracker system which does not give you things or does not or can't give them to you all the time. But when you go to some special place it can either track and measure you or also influence your development by using stored energy.

I think I like the last option more. So, things happen and develop and are hinted at during travels, but then the character has the option of going to, let's call it the watcher, to measure what happened and to then ask for guidance, or to formalise what he started learning and doing and having energy for into something structured like a skill or something.

The idea here is that instead of this omnipotent system as usual in the genre, we have more like observer-measurer and influencer system. So, it's not omnipotent and it's not everywhere, but when the character comes to an interface (let's make it a stone or a chamber or whatever), they can communicate through that interface with the system, and the system can measure and influence the development of their body and the spread of their energy.

# Skill evolutions. 

The idea is that the skills can't just change arbitrarily. They need to evolve in some sort of way sequential branching order. So the next one we are arriving to needs to have the prerequisites so it's compatible

The way we implement that kind of system is that we have a symbiont growing inside the character which can change their body and which basically works as an organ for energy manipulation. To accommodate new skills and abilities, it needs to mutate in a way that's kind of a skill tree. It can't mutate from anything to anything; it needs to happen in connected sequences.
