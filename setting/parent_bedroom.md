## Narrative Description (for Writers)

The parents' private retreat designed for rest and intimate conversation. Following the cultural floor-sleeping tradition, the adults share a thick, floor mattress piled with fine blankets and soft pillows.

A small seating area near the window provides space for quiet evening talks over tea, while the carved wardrobe holds their clothing and personal belongings. Wall niches display meaningful objects collected over years of partnership, lit by the warm glow of oil lamps during evening hours.
