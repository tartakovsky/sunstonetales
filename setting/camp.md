## Narrative Description (for Writers)

This is where children experience their first real independence—a camp deep enough in the jungle that home feels distant, yet structured enough that adults maintain gentle oversight. 

Evening fires reflect on the dark water while jungle sounds create a symphony around the camp. It's designed to feel like a real adventure: sleeping under canvas, cooking over open fires, and waking to mist rising from the lake. For a young kit, this represents a significant milestone toward grown-up independence.

**Key Details:**
- **Location:** Deeper jungle, removed from familiar residential paths
- **Organization:** Tents and fires arranged near the lake for safety and community
- **Purpose:** First major independence experience for children
