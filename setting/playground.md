## Narrative Description (for Writers)

**Atmosphere:** Organized chaos with mixed-age cat-like children (kits) playing freely under volunteer supervision. Energetic but safe environment where learning happens through play and peer interaction.

**Sounds:** Children's laughter, creaking wood, older kits teaching younger ones songs and games

**Key Elements for Writers:**
- **Supervision:** Respected community volunteer overseeing, not formal instruction
- **Social Dynamic:** Older children naturally mentor younger ones
- **Safety:** Enclosed feeling from surrounding walls while open to Yard community
- **Activity:** Storytelling circles, observational games, physical play blending together
