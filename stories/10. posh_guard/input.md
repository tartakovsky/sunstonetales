## Plot Points

1. **Opening scene**: Liska and parents arrive at the busy weekend market, Liska excited by all the sights, sounds, and smells.
    - Liska's tail swishes excitedly as she takes in all the colorful stalls
    - Market described through sensory details (sounds of haggling, smell of spices and sea air)
2. **Distraction moment**: Parents stop at furniture stall to look at a lamp for their new home.
    - Parents become engrossed in conversation with vendor
    - Liska initially stays close, but becomes bored with adult talk
3. **Temptation**: Liska smells something delicious and spots a fish kebab stall.
    - Description of the sizzling fish kebabs with their golden-brown color
    - Liska's mouth waters and her stomach growls
    - Repetitive phrase: "The kebabs smelled SO good!"
4. **Impulsive decision**: Without thinking, Liska follows her nose to the kebab stall.
    - She weaves through forest of adult legs
    - Doesn't realize how far she's going from parents
5. **Realization**: Liska arrives at the stall but turns to find only a sea of unfamiliar faces and tall legs. She can't see her parents anywhere.
6. **Emotional Moment (Fear - Little Mouse)**: A wave of fear washes over Liska. She feels tiny and helpless, like a little mouse in a big, scary world. Her instinct is to hide.
7. **Hiding**: Liska scurries to the nearest safe-looking spot: under the counter of the busy Kebab Man's stall. She curls up, hidden from view.
8. **Internal Conflict & Bravery**: Hidden under the counter, Liska feels a little safer, but she realizes: "Hiding keeps me from being scared, but it won't help Mama and Papa find me." She makes the brave choice to get help.
9. **First Helper (The Kebab Man)**: Liska crawls out and tugs on the Kebab Man's apron. He is a large, warm presence. He immediately stops his work, kneels down, and speaks in a soft, booming voice.
    - "Well now, what's this? A little snow leopard cub! Don't you worry a whisker. You're at the safest stall in the whole market."
10. **The Chain of Help**: The Kebab Man comforts her, then explains the next step.
    - "Finding families is a very important job, you see. So for that, we need to call in the expert. He knows *exactly* what to do." He rings a crisp, loud brass bell on his counter.
11. **Second Helper (The Guard)**: The Guard arrives with a quiet, efficient presence. He is impeccably dressed and very formal. He nods to the Kebab Man ("Thank you for the signal.") then kneels to Liska's level.
    - He speaks calmly and respectfully: "Good afternoon, young miss. It appears we have a situation. My job is to help sort out situations just like this. Shall we begin?"
12. **Problem-solving**: The Guard asks Liska to describe her parents.
    - Liska gives a simple description: "They're snow leopards like me but bigger. Mama has a purple dress with a moon necklace. Papa is really big."
    - Guard repeats the description in overly formal language: "Excellent. A lady adorned in purple with a lunar ornament and a gentleman of significant stature. A most clear description."
13. **Empowering Liska (The Lookout)**: The Guard observes the crowd.
    - "It is rather difficult to see from down here. Mostly knees. I propose the following: with your permission, I shall lift you onto my shoulder. You shall be my official lookout."
    - The respectful request gives Liska an important, active role. She nods eagerly.
14. **The Lift**: The Guard formally lifts Liska up above the crowd. She can now see over everyone's heads.
15. **Participation Moment**: Opportunity for children to help Liska and the guard look.
    - "Can you help Liska look for her parents?"
    - Repetitive phrase: "Do you see any snow leopards?"
16. **Recognition**: Liska spots her parents looking frantically around.
    - "There they are! That's my mama and papa!"
17. **Reunion**: The Guard carries Liska to her parents with a dignified, formal march.
    - To the parents: "Pardon me. We were just concluding a successful search operation."
    - To Liska, as he sets her down: "Your duties as lookout are complete. A job very well done." He gives her a small, respectful nod.
18. **Gentle Lesson**: The Guard gently reminds both Liska and parents about market safety.
    - To parents: "I must most respectfully suggest maintaining visual contact with your offspring at all times."
    - To Liska: "And young miss, one must always inform one's guardians before embarking on independent expeditions."
19. **Closing scene**: The family, reunited and relieved, goes together to the Kebab Man's stall.
    - They thank both the Kebab Man and the Guard.
    - They buy kebabs for everyone, including one for the Guard.
    - Liska waves goodbye to the Guard, who gives a formal bow in response.
