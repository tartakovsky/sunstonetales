# Polished Narrative Storyboard

---

## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere
The market in Sarabád was a wonderful mix of smells. Liska's nose twitched, trying to catch the sweet melon scent as it hid from the sharp smell of fish. Suddenly, a goat bleated right in her ear! Liska jumped. Her tail, which had been swishing happily, flicked up into a startled question mark before settling back down.

### Beat 1.2: Introduce character(s)
Liska saw a stall full of shiny blue glass and darted toward it. A moment later, she scampered back to her mother, Mara, who laughed and ruffled her fur. "What's our market rule, little one?" Mara asked. Liska puffed out her chest. "Don't run away!"
"And if you get lost?"
"Find a helper!"
Her father, Daric, looked up from a rug he was examining. "That's right," he added. "Someone you know, like the Kebab-Man. Or anyone working at a stall."

## Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
Liska's parents were talking about boring grown-up things. Something about wooden boxes. Liska tried to have her own fun. She sniffed a big pot. *Boring.* She patted the leg of the man running the stall. It felt like a tree trunk. *Also boring.* She tried standing on one leg like a flamingo, but she wobbled and tumbled right into a basket of soft silks. No one even noticed. Liska let out a long, heavy sigh. Grown-ups were so slow.

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst (Misstep / Misjudgment / Accidental Event)
Then, a delicious smell ambushed her. Sizzling, wonderful kebabs! It was coming from the Kebab-Man's stall—her favorite place! All the boring thoughts disappeared. Now there was only one thought: *KEBABS*. Her little nose led the way, and her feet just followed, taking her deep into a forest of grown-up legs. Her tail pointed straight out from behind her.

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident (The External Problem / Challenge)
She made it! She reached the kebab stall with a happy grin, ready to turn and show her parents. But the words got stuck. Mama's purple dress was gone. Papa's tall, kind head was gone. Liska's grin melted away. Her tail, which had been swishing with excitement, drooped sadly to the ground. She spun in a slow circle, but all she could see was the forest of strange legs. The warm, happy kebab-feeling in her tummy turned into a cold, wobbly uh-oh. They were gone. Liska was lost.

### Beat 2.4: Fallout
A wave of fear washed over her. A moment ago, she was a brave snow leopard. Now, she felt like just a tiny little mouse in a world of giants. Her shoulders hunched up to her ears. Her body curled inward, trying to become as small as possible. So small no one could step on her. So small she might just disappear. All she wanted to do was hide.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve / Unravel – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Recovery
[Thinking] like a mouse, Liska scurried under the counter of the kebab stall. In the darkness, curled up into a little ball, she was hidden from the scary forest of legs. *Phew.* The legs were gone. But the big, wobbly feeling of being all alone was still there. It was trapped inside her chest.

### Beat 3.2: Attempt 1
Just hiding wasn't working. She had to *do* something. Liska took a shaky little breath and peeked out from under the counter. A pair of enormous, dusty boots stomped past. *THUMP. THUMP.* The world was too big and much too loud. She darted back into the darkness, her heart hammering against her ribs like a drum. A sticky spiderweb tickled her nose. *A-choo!* It was a tiny, dusty sneeze. *Oh no! Now everyone will find me!* she thought. But no one did. And somehow, that felt even lonelier.

### Beat 3.3: Attempt 2
She had to try again. From her hiding spot, she saw a large, still shape standing at the counter above. A shape that wasn't moving felt safer than the stomping boots. Liska gathered up all her courage. She tried to shout "Help!" but all that came out was a tiny, hopeful squeak. It was a little mouse sound, and the big roar of the market swallowed it right up. The shape didn't move. No one had heard her.

### Beat 3.4: Low Point
A wave of hopelessness washed over her. She scrambled back into the darkness, her body suddenly feeling as [limp as a floppy noodle]. *They're gone forever,* she thought. She imagined living under this counter for the rest of her life, eating nothing but dropped crumbs. She curled herself into a tight, tight ball, feeling small and lost like a forgotten toy, and pulled her fluffy tail over her eyes to make the world go away.

### Beat 3.5: Recovery
Hidden in the dark, she began to rock, ever so slightly. She hugged her fluffy tail close to her chest, clutching it tight. The familiar softness quieted the scary drum inside her. *Thump-thump-thump... thump...* And in that tiny moment of quiet, a sound floated down from above: a big, warm laugh, like a hug made of sound.

### Beat 3.6: Re-evaluation
The kind sound made her freeze. She knew that laugh! It belonged to the Kebab-Man. Suddenly, her mother's rule marched into her head with a little drumbeat: *Find a helper you know, or one working at a stall.* The Kebab-Man was both! Hope gave a tiny, brave wiggle inside her chest.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Final Attempt
This was it. She took a deep breath that was only a little bit shaky, and crawled out from under the counter. The forest of legs was still there and still scary, but the Kebab-man's long apron was like a safe, solid wall. Liska had a plan.

### Beat 4.2: Rising Tension
She reached up a trembling paw and gave the apron a tiny, hesitant tug. Nothing happened. He was busy, shouting an order for more fish. The cold wave of fear washed over her again. Her paw started to pull back. Her courage was melting.

### Beat 4.3: The Turning Point
But then, she looked at her own paw, still touching the apron. She stared at it, making sure it was being brave. *No more mouse*, she told herself. Taking another deep breath, she made her paw into a determined little fist and gave two firm tugs. *TUG. TUG.* The Kebab-Man stopped shouting. He looked down and saw a tiny, trembling paw holding fast to his apron. "Little one! Where did you come from? Are you lost?" His questions were kind, but Liska had to find her voice to answer. "Mama... lost," she whispered. Then, remembering the rule, she added, "Papa said... find a helper." "Oh!" the Kebab-Man boomed softly, kneeling down. He scooped Liska up and sat her on a tall stool next to his stall, a safe island in the river of legs. "There now, little one." He passed her a small piece of warm bread. Liska took a shaky nibble.

### Beat 4.4: Success (External Problem Resolved)
"I know just the person," he said. He called for Guard Omar. The Guard approached, his presence calm and steady. He knelt down. "That was very brave, asking for help," he said gently. "Who are we looking for?" Liska described her mama's purple dress and her papa being "really, really big." The Guard nodded. "A clear description. Look. A snow leopard belongs on the highest mountain. To see everything. My shoulder shall be your mountain." He lifted her onto his shoulder—her very own mountain peak! From up here, Liska could see everything. The forest of legs became a sea of hats. She wasn't a Little Mouse anymore; she was a Giant Snow Leopard on top of the world. Her arm stretched out straight and true, her whole paw pointing. "There they are!"

### Beat 4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief (Accomplishment & Positive Emotion)
"Mama! Papa!" The Guard marched her right to them. She slammed into her mother's legs, burying her face in the familiar fabric of her dress. Then two huge, safe arms scooped her up, and she was pressed between both her parents in a hug so tight it squeezed a happy squeak out of her. It was a hug that smelled like Mama, felt the deep rumble of Papa's chest, and sounded like them both whispering her name over and over. "A job very well done," the Guard announced with formal gravity, tipping his hat. Then he gave her a slow, secret wink.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Catharsis
Back at the kebab stall, Daric bought kebabs for everyone. Liska, sitting proudly on her stool, decided to tell the whole story. "It started with KEBABS!" she announced loudly. "Sooo delicious! But then... you were gone! I was a tiny little mouse, all alone! And lost! And I went *squeak*! Then I TUGGED! And then I heard the Kebab-Man! And then the Man-Mountain came, and I was a GIANT SNOW LEOPARD!" She finished with a triumphant roar, standing on her stool with her chest puffed out. The Kebab-Man laughed. The Guard nodded with great seriousness. "An excellent report of your mission. And now," he took a solemn bite, "the situation is officially delicious."

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration (Acknowledging & Embodying Change)
After the story, Mara squeezed Liska's paw. "You were so brave to ask for help." Liska looked up at her mother and squeezed back—a tight, quick squeeze that said, *I understand now*. It was a promise to remember to be brave. Then she gave a second squeeze, this one softer. That was a promise to try *very* hard not to let go of her paw in the first place.

### Beat 5.3: New Status Quo / Harmonious Scene (Character Transformed)
After they finished eating, Guard Omar stood and brushed the crumbs from his uniform. "My thanks for the excellent meal," he said with a nod. "I must return to my duties." He turned to go, but then looked back at Liska. He gave her that same slow, formal wink. Liska giggled around the last bite of her kebab. "Goodbye, Man-Mountain," she whispered after he was gone. Her tail tapped a calm rhythm against her father's leg: *found-and-safe, found-and-safe*.

### Beat 5.4: Concluding Thought / Wrap-up
Safely nestled between her parents, Liska took a happy bite of her kebab. She decided that finding helpers was a very good plan. But holding Papa's hand, she thought, was an even better one.
