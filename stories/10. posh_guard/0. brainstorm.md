### Narrative Architecture

1. The Emotion: The Little Mouse (Мышонок) Instinct
Trigger: Liska realizes she is lost in the forest of legs.
Emotion: The Little Mouse metaphor is perfect here. It's not about freezing in panic (Icicle), but about the overwhelming instinct to become small, unseen, and find a safe, enclosed space.
Action: Liska follows this instinct. She doesn't run far. She scurries to the nearest place that feels like a den: under the counter of the busy Kebab Man's stall. She curls up, effectively hiding.

2. The Internal Conflict: The Limit of Hiding
The Scene: Liska is now hidden. From her perspective, she is safe from the scary, moving legs. But she's still alone, and her parents are still gone.
The Turning Point: A moment of cognitive clarity pierces the fear. She realizes: "Hiding keeps me safe, but it won't help me be found." This is a crucial moment of agency. She has to overcome the Little Mouse instinct to solve her problem.
The Action of Bravery: She makes a choice. She crawls out from her hiding spot and tugs on the Kebab Man's apron or tunic.

#### 3. The First Helper: The Kebab Man (The Anchor)
*   He is a large, warm, reassuring presence. When he sees the lost child, he immediately stops everything. His focus is entirely on her.
*   **Personality:** He is the anchor of safety. Let's imagine him as having a warm, booming voice that he can instantly soften. He smells of grilled fish and a hint of cinnamon.
*   **Action & Dialogue:** He kneels down. *"Well now, what's this? A little snow leopard cub! Don't you worry a whisker. You're at the safest stall in the market."* He provides immediate comfort, then explains the next, proper step. *"Finding families is a very important job. We need to call in the expert. He knows exactly what to do."*
*   **The Signal:** He rings a crisp, loud brass bell on his counter.

#### 4. The Second Helper: The Guard (The Gentle Guide)
*   The guard arrives, not with bluster, but with a quiet, efficient presence. He is the epitome of gentle, formal competence. His uniform is immaculate.
*   **Personality:** A "British butler in a kindergarten." He treats Liska with the utmost gravity and respect, as if she were a small dignitary. His language is proper but never condescending.
*   **The Handoff & Interaction:**
    *   He nods to the Kebab Man. "Thank you for the signal."
    *   He kneels to Liska's level. His voice is calm and even. "Good afternoon, young miss. It appears we have a situation. My job is to help sort out situations just like this. Shall we begin?"
    *   He doesn't use jargon. He asks simple questions with formal framing: "Now then, to find your parents, it would be a great help if you could describe them for me."
    *   When Liska describes them, he nods seriously. "Excellent. A lady in purple and a gentleman of significant size. A very clear description."

#### 5. The Solution: Empowering the Child
*   The guard observes the crowd. "It is rather difficult to see from down here. Mostly knees. I propose the following: with your permission, I will lift you onto my shoulder. You shall be my lookout."
*   This language is respectful, asks for consent, and gives Liska an active, important role.
*   He lifts her gently. She spots her parents.
*   **The Reunion:** He walks her over with a dignified pace.
    *   To the parents: "Pardon me. We were just concluding a successful search."
    -   To Liska, as he sets her down: "Your duties as lookout are complete. A job very well done." He gives her a small, respectful nod.

This refined architecture creates a more powerful and believable story. It teaches a clear safety lesson (find a stationary vendor), models a "chain of help" (vendor calls guard), and provides two distinct, positive adult helper figures: the warm, anchoring Kebab Man and the calm, formal Guard.


Why This New Architecture Excels:
Psychologically Accurate: It correctly models a child's fear-response (hide) and the internal struggle required to overcome it.
Teaches a Safer Strategy: The core lesson is to find the nearest stationary adult worker and that this person will initiate a larger process. This is a much better real-world strategy.
Creates the "Chain of Help": It shows that helpers work together, which is a sophisticated and valuable safety concept.
Enhances Character & Humor: It gives both the Kebab Man and the Guard distinct, complementary roles that build a richer, more entertaining world.



The Handoff:
Kebab Man: "Ahoy, Guard! We have a situation here. One lost cub, high and dry."
