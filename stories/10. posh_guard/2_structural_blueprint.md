# Story Structure: 5-act + Dysregulation + Solution Discovery

## Act 1: Introduction
### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere
Text:
> The Sarabád market buzzed with colorful stalls and the smell of grilled fish and sweet melons. Liska, a little snow leopard, tried to look everywhere at once. Her tail swished with excitement in the salty breeze.
<!-- 
Fun/Engagement: Use `Wonder and Awe: Sensory Discovery` to describe the market from Liska's perspective, making the familiar feel new and exciting.
-->

### Beat 1.2: Introduce character(s)
Text:
> Liska's tail swished with excitement. She darted a few steps toward a stall selling shiny blue glass, then remembered herself and scampered back to her mother, Mara. Mara laughed. "It's a big place, my little snowflake," she said, giving Liska's paw a squeeze. "What's our market rule?" Liska puffed up her chest. "Find a helper!" "That's right," her father, Daric, added. "Someone we know, or anyone working at a stall."
<!--
Fun/Engagement:
- Fun: `Adorable Effort` (Liska puffing her chest) and `Awkward Grace` (her quick, impulsive scamper).
- Engagement: `Interactive Engagement: Repetition & Refrains` (establishing the "market rule" which will be a key plot point).
- Character: Show Liska's `impulsive` nature, but also her attachment, as she returns on her own. Use `pet_names.md` for "snowflake".
-->

## Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins
### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
Text:
> Liska's parents stopped at a pottery stall, lost in a serious talk about the subtle differences between eggshell and ecru-colored glazes. Liska waited, but soon her tail stopped swishing. The world of grown-ups was very slow.
<!--
Fun/Engagement:
- Fun: `Relatable Parenting` and `Dual-Layer Humor`. The adult gets the joke about home decor, the child just sees boring pots.
- Engagement: `Relatability` (the feeling of being bored while adults talk).
-->

<!-- lamp is boring? Something more relatable, let's make this beat fun for adults, but boring for children. -->

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst (Misstep / Misjudgment / Accidental Event)
Text:
> Suddenly, a delicious smell danced past her nose. It was sizzling fish kebabs from the Kebab-Man's stall—her favorite! Her mouth watered, and without thinking, she followed the wonderful smell through a forest of tall legs.
<!--
Fun/Engagement:
- Engagement: `Temptation`.
- Character: Use Liska's `Temptation` tells from `emotional_tells.md` (leaning forward, fixated eyes, tail pointing straight with a bend). Establishes her familiarity with the Kebab-Man.
-->

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident (The External Problem / Challenge)
Text:
> She reached the kebab stall and turned to share her discovery, but saw only a sea of unfamiliar legs. Her parents were gone. Liska was lost.
<!--
Engagement: `Tension`, `Surprise`.
Character: The emotional sequence should be granular: 1. Surprise/Confusion (Head tilted, "Hmm?"). 2. Rising Anxiety (Frantic searching). 3. Overwhelming Fear (Freezes, wide eyes, gasp) as per `emotional_tells.md`.
-->

### Beat 2.4: Fallout
Text:
> A wave of fear made her feel tiny and helpless, like a little mouse in a big, scary world. Her heart thumped against her ribs. Her only thought was to hide.
<!--
Character:
- Emotion: `Fear / Anxiety` group.
- Metaphor: `Little Mouse (Мышонок)`.
- Dysregulation: `Alone - High Distress` (flight/hide response).
-->

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve / Unravel – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil
### Beat 3.1: Recovery (Optional)
Text:
> Liska's first instinct wasn't to solve the problem, but to manage her overwhelming fear. Hiding was her way to recover from the initial shock and the noise of the crowd.

### Beat 3.2: Attempt 1 (Initial Reaction / Less Considered Approach)
Text:
> Following her "Little Mouse" instinct, Liska scurried under the counter of the kebab stall. She curled up, hidden from the forest of legs. Being unseen made the world less scary, but it didn't solve the real problem.
<!--
Character: This is Liska's `auto_coping` behavior for `Fear (Flight Response)` from `auto_coping.md` (Hiding).
-->

### Beat 3.3: Attempt 2 (Developing Approach / New Complication)
Text:
> The initial relief of being hidden quickly fades. Under the counter, the world is dark and dusty. The happy sounds of the market are muffled and distant, making her feel even more alone. She can hear her own heart thumping nervously. Hiding wasn't safe, it was just... lonely. The big, scary feeling of being lost was still there, now trapped in the small, dark space with her.
<!--
Character: Use `Loneliness / Isolation` tells from `emotional_tells.md` (curled up small, quiet sniffle) to show the failure of her hiding strategy.
-->

<!-- here we lack any actual attempt, we just continue the description. Maybe she tries to cope somehow but that doesn't help. -->

### Beat 3.4: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)
Text:
> A hopeless feeling washed over her, making her body feel limp like a deflating balloon. Curling into a tight ball, she pulled her tail over her eyes and whimpered. Mama and Papa were gone forever.
<!--
Character:
- Emotion: `Helplessness / Powerlessness`. Use tells like body going limp, a defeated sigh. This is the feeling of the `Deflating Balloon` metaphor.
- Dysregulation: `Alone - High Distress` is at its peak here.
-->

### Beat 3.5: Recovery
Text:
> Rocking slightly, Liska pulled her fluffy tail to her chest, hugging it tightly with both paws. The familiar feeling helped the scary feeling shrink just a little. Through her fear, she heard a new sound from above: a warm, booming laugh.
<!--
Character: This shows a different `auto_coping` behavior from `auto_coping.md` (clutching tail to chest). The recovery is then scaffolded by the external cue.
-->

### Beat 3.6: Re-evaluation
Text:
> The kind voice made her pause. She knew that laugh! It was the Kebab-Man. Like a sunbeam, she remembered the rule: find a helper you know, or one working at a stall. The Kebab-Man was both!
<!--
Engagement: `Cognitive Problem-Solving` (remembering the rule).
Process: `Solution Discovery Process: Remembering & Applying Past Solution`. The personal recognition makes the breakthrough more powerful.
-->

## Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally
### Beat 4.1: Final Attempt / Approach (Applying New Understanding / Changed Behaviour)
Text:
> Taking a shaky breath, Liska crawled out from under the counter. She reached up a small paw and gave a tiny tug on the Kebab Man's apron.
<!--
Engagement: `Tension`, `Empowerment` (taking action).
Coping: `My "I Need Help" Plan`.
-->

### Beat 4.2: Rising Tension / Suspense
Text:
> The Kebab Man immediately stopped, his presence warm and reassuring as he knelt down. He introduced the approaching Guard as a trusted friend and an expert at finding families. Then he rang a loud brass bell, signaling the "chain of help" was in motion.
<!--
Fun/Engagement:
- Fun: Character humor from the contrast between the warm Kebab Man and the formal Guard.
- Engagement: `Anticipation`, `Suspense`.
- Support: The Kebab Man provides `Social Navigation Support` by bridging the trust-transfer to the Guard.
-->

### Beat 4.3: The Turning Point / Final Push (Demonstrating Growth in Action)
Text:
> The Guard knelt. "And who are we looking for?" he asked calmly. Liska described her mama's purple dress and her papa being "really, really big." The Guard nodded. "A clear description. But from down here, all I see are knees. With your permission, you shall be my lookout."
<!--
Fun/Engagement:
- Fun: `Serious Formality` and `Dry Understatement` from the Guard.
- Engagement: `Empowerment`, `Child Agency`. This is now more concise and includes the key interaction.
-->

### Beat 4.4: Success (External Problem Resolved)
Text:
> Perched high on the Guard's shoulder, Liska could finally see over the crowd. She scanned the market until she saw two familiar snow leopards looking around frantically. "There they are!" she cried out.
<!--
Engagement: `Interactive Engagement: Direct Questions` ("Can you help Liska look for her parents? Do you see them?"). The `Reveal`.
-->

### Beat 4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief (Accomplishment & Positive Emotion)
Text:
> "Mama! Papa!" Liska cried as the Guard marched her over. Mara and Daric swept her into a giant, relieved hug that smelled like home. The Guard tipped his hat. "Your lookout has completed her duties. A job very well done."
<!--
Engagement: `Relief`. The emotional reunion is the primary reward, strengthened by the parental hug.
Guideline: Using `Process Praise` reinforces the value of her contribution.
-->

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth
### Beat 5.1: Relaxation / Immediate Aftermath (Processing the Journey)
Text:
> The reunited family went to the Kebab Man's stall to thank both helpers. They bought delicious kebabs for everyone, and the mood was relieved and happy.
<!--
Fun/Engagement: Modeling gratitude is a key pro-social lesson. The shared meal brings the story full circle, fulfilling the initial desire in a safe, connected context.
-->

### Beat 5.2: Reflection & Learning (Internalizing the Lesson & Growth)
Text:
> As they walked from the stall, Mara held Liska's paw tightly. "You were so brave to ask for help," she whispered. "That was exactly the right thing to do."
<!-- 
This beat now shows the parent gently reinforcing the positive action, which is more developmentally appropriate than a lecture.
-->

### Beat 5.3: Making it Right / Integration (Acknowledging & Embodying Change)
Text:
> Liska looked up at her mother and squeezed her paw back. It was a silent promise to remember the rule, and to try her best to stay close.
<!--
This is a simple, non-verbal "making it right" action from Liska, showing she understands and agrees.
-->

### Beat 5.4: New Status Quo / Harmonious Scene (Character Transformed)
Text:
> The family sat together, munching on their delicious kebabs. Liska's tail swished happily, tapping a soft rhythm against her father's leg. Nearby, she could hear the Guard's formal chuckle mixing with the Kebab-Man's booming laugh.
<!--
This is a more active "show, don't tell" version of the scene, focusing on sensory details to convey safety and happiness.
-->

### Beat 5.5: Concluding Thought / Wrap-up
Text:
> Safely nestled between her parents, Liska took a happy bite of her kebab. She decided that finding helpers was a very good plan. But holding Papa's hand, she thought, was an even better one.
<!--
Engagement: `Cognitive`. This is Liska's own future-looking thought, showing she has internalized the lesson in her own, child-like terms without needing a lecture. It provides a sense of closure and security.
-->
