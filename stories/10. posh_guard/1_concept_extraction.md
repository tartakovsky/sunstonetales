# Initial Q&A for Story Specification

**Note:** The answers provided below are not final and are intended as examples of the type of information that should be provided for a specific book.

You MUST read every file in the input list before respoding. Load it all into your context.

**Required Input List:**
- **Universal Input:**
  - Emotional Metaphors: [emotional_metaphors.md](mdc:context/emotional_metaphors.md)
  - Emotion Unfolding Sequence: [emotion_unfolding_sequence.md](mdc:context/emotion_unfolding_sequence.md)
  Strategies: [coping_strategies.csv](mdc:context/slots/coping_strategies.csv)
- **Character-Specific Input, e.g. for Liska:**
  - Emotional Tells: [emotional_tells.md](mdc:context/characters/Liska/emotional_tells.md)
  - Auto-Coping Behaviors: [auto_coping.md](mdc:context/characters/Liska/auto_coping.md)
  - Learned Coping Strategies: [learned_coping.md](mdc:context/characters/Liska/learned_coping.md)

Your job is to not only sort through what's in the input, but also to correct it and bring it closer to reality. E.g. if the input only mentions the character to be sad, but the actual emotion set would be more complex / different, it is your job to identify the set of actual emotions that would happen in such context. Then when you choose the most important emotions and how they unfold, you must choose from that list of actual emotions, not only from what's written.

**1. Who are the main characters in the story?**  
**A:** Liska (protagonist), The Kebab Man (first helper), The Guard (second helper), Mother Mara & Father Daric (supporting characters).

---

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** Liska impulsively wanders away from her parents in a crowded market and gets lost.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** Liska experiences acute fear, triggering a primal instinct to hide. To be found, she must overcome this fear and learn to trust and interact with a series of unfamiliar but safe adult helpers.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** When lost, find a safe, stationary adult (like a shopkeeper), who will know how to help you and can start a "chain of help."

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** Liska learns to overcome the paralyzing fear-instinct to hide and instead take the brave step of asking a safe-looking adult for help.

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  

**A:**
- **Temptation:** Liska smells the kebabs and feels an irresistible pull toward them, causing her to wander off.
- **Fear (Little Mouse):** Upon realizing she is lost, Liska feels an overwhelming instinct to become small and hide.

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** **Fear** is central. While temptation initiates the plot, the core of the story is about Liska's experience of being lost, the psychologically accurate fear-response of hiding, and learning to overcome that instinct to actively seek help.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** **Fear.**
**Comments:** The fear of separation from a caregiver is a primary developmental challenge for 4-6-year-olds. This story addresses it by modeling a realistic fear response (hiding) and then teaching a concrete, safe, and effective strategy to move from that passive state of fear to an active state of problem-solving. It's not just about feeling fear, but about what you *do* with it.

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** Fear will be visualized as the **Little Mouse (Мышонок)** metaphor.
**Comment:** This metaphor is chosen because it perfectly captures the instinct to hide, feel small, and seek a safe, enclosed space when overwhelmed and scared. This aligns directly with the updated story architecture where Liska's first action is to hide under the Kebab Man's stall.

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** The story teaches a sophisticated version of **My "I Need Help" Plan**.
**Comments:** The solution is not just "find an adult," but a safer, more practical "chain of help." Liska learns to approach a stationary, trustworthy-seeming adult (the Kebab Man at his stall), who then knows to call the "expert" (the Guard). This models a realistic and secure method for seeking help, emphasizing that some helpers are anchors who can connect a child to the right kind of assistance.

**11. Write a paragraph summarizing the story.**
**A:** Lured by the delicious smell of kebabs at a bustling market, Liska wanders away from her parents and finds herself lost. Overcome with fear, she feels like a tiny mouse and instinctively hides under the kebab seller's stall. But soon, Liska realizes that hiding won't help her be found. Mustering her courage, she asks the kind Kebab Man for help. He comforts her and calls for the official Guard, a formal but gentle man who empowers Liska by making her his "lookout." Perched on the Guard's shoulder, Liska spots her parents, leading to a happy reunion. The story teaches that when you're lost and scared, the bravest thing to do is find a safe adult who can start a "chain of help."
