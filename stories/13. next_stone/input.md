1. The Next Stone
   * Unique Trait: Sees stories as ongoing, not finished.
   * Conflict: An elder tells a sacred story from a "Story Stone," which is considered a complete,
     unchangeable mark.
   * Low Point: Liska asks "what happened next?" and is told the story is finished and the mark
     cannot be added to.
   * Paw Print's Role: Reminds her that her own first mark (the print) was a beginning, not an end.
   * Physical Mark: She finds a new stone, places it next to the old one, and draws the "next" part
     of the story, adding her paw print to her new chapter.
