**1. Who are the main characters in the story?**  
**A:** Liska (protagonist), Mother Mara (supporting character and co-regulator)

---

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** Liska sucks her tail tip as a self-soothing habit during low-stimulation moments like falling asleep or when bored, despite minor physical consequences like soreness.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** While the primary issue is personal, there's a subtle social impact as Liska's reliance on tail sucking may limit her engagement in shared activities or interactions during passive moments, potentially causing mild frustration or disconnection with family members like Mara who wish to help her find healthier ways to cope.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** Liska discovers a new, portable self-soothing habit (a tactile finger motion or game) that fulfills her sensory need for comfort, motivated by a special connection with Mara and small rewards.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** Liska learns to recognize her feelings of boredom or need for coziness and consciously choose to use a new tactile habit, like tracing a pattern on her hand, instead of tail sucking.

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  
**A:**
- Boredom -> Restlessness: During passive moments like waiting or listening to a story, Liska feels bored, leading to a restless urge to suck her tail for stimulation (aligned with Boredom/Disinterest from emotion_groups.csv).
- Need for Comfort -> Calm: When falling asleep, Liska seeks comfort and coziness, using tail sucking to transition to a calm state (aligned with Calm/Peace from emotion_groups.csv).

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** Boredom and the need for comfort are central as the story focuses on Liska learning to manage these states with a healthier self-soothing method instead of tail sucking.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** Boredom (resulting in restlessness) - It's critical for 4-6-year-olds to learn to handle boredom constructively to build self-regulation and prevent reliance on potentially harmful habits like thumb or tail sucking.  
**Comments:** Two options from the input are Boredom and Need for Comfort. Boredom is developmentally significant because it often triggers automatic habits like thumb sucking in low-stimulation contexts, and learning to manage it fosters independence and creativity. Need for Comfort is also significant as it ties to emotional security, but since tail sucking at bedtime is more ingrained and less socially disruptive, addressing boredom in passive moments offers a broader impact on daily behavior. If we consider an emotion outside the raw input, Helplessness could be relevant due to the child's lack of internal motivation to stop, but Boredom remains the priority as it's the primary trigger in multiple contexts.

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** Boredom will be visualized as a metaphor to be designed, representing a restless, itchy feeling in her paws that drives the need for stimulation.  
**Comment:** There is no suitable metaphor for Boredom in the provided list in emotional_metaphors.md. A new metaphor needs to be designed to represent this emotion and behavior trigger to avoid confusion with other emotional states.

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** Liska learns to use a new, portable self-soothing habit that can become automatic over time, providing tactile comfort without requiring mental engagement, to replace tail sucking when feeling bored or needing comfort. (Specific behavior to be determined based on input requirements)  
**Comments:** The coping behavior must be a simple, always-available tactile action that directly competes with the sensory need met by tail sucking, especially in passive or bedtime contexts. It should require minimal attention and mental engagement, allowing it to become an automatic response over time, as emphasized in the input documents. The specific behavior will be designed to align with the user's requirement for an effortless substitute, potentially a repetitive tactile motion that can be done without conscious focus.

**11. Write a paragraph summarizing the story.**  
**A:** In this story, Liska, a young snow leopard cub, habitually sucks her tail tip for comfort when falling asleep or feeling bored during quiet moments, despite it causing slight soreness. Her caring mother, Mara, gently helps Liska notice her feelings of boredom or need for coziness, labeling them to build emotional awareness. Mara introduces a special 'big-kid secret'—a simple tactile habit to be determined—as a new way to feel calm and occupied. Though Liska struggles at first, reverting to her old habit, Mara's validation and a visual calendar for tracking successes with stars motivate her to keep trying. Through small victories at bedtime and during passive moments, Liska gradually learns to choose her new habit, feeling pride in her progress and a deeper connection with Mara, culminating in a shared celebration of her growing independence.
