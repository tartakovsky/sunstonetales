I need a story to help wean off my 5yo child from finger sucking. She sucks her right thumb and with left rubs and pulls her left nipple, always together.

I intend to tell a story about Liska, a snow leopard cub, who sucks her tail tip.

My child sucks finger when:
- to fall asleep
- I think when she's bored
- I have similar reaction, I need something to do with my hands when I'm working with my brain or consuming video info. It's not enough to have only one info channel occupied, I need at least two.

Let's brainstorm how can it be framed.

- Why do children suck fingers? 
- What are the best things we can write about in a story to help them wean off?
- My daughter knows perfectly well why it's bad for her. She did have a small wound both on her nipple and her thumb. She has a callous on her thumb all the time. She knows that will make her teeth deformed. She still both chooses to do that, and has that as an automatic reaction.
