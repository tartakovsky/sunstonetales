# Story Outline: Liska's Heart-Shaped Paw

## Core Idea
Liska learns that her intense emotionality isn't a flaw, but an intrinsic part of who she is, symbolized by a unique heart-shaped paw pad she has had since birth.

## Characters
*   **Liska:** An intensely emotional kitten.
*   **Mother (Mara):** Wise, loving, and helps Liska understand herself.
*   **Other Kittens:** Including a visiting kitten, who act as the social trigger.

### **Part 1: The Incident - A Painful Misunderstanding**

1.  **Setting:** The backyard. Liska is playing with other kittens.
2.  **The Trigger:** A visiting kitten shares that his mother has gone to care for his sick grandmother, and he doesn't know when she will be back.
3.  **Liska's Reaction (Triggered Separation Anxiety):** The visiting kitten's story acts as a trigger for Liska's own deep-seated separation anxiety. The thought of a mother not returning sends her into a panic about her *own* parents. Her reaction isn't about the other kitten; it's a full-blown expression of her own internal fear. She cries out, **"But he doesn't know when she's coming back! He's all alone!"** and starts looking frantically for her own mother.
4.  **The Conflict (Social Rejection):** The other kittens, unable to understand the depth of her personal panic, recoil. One of them mocks her, saying, **"You're being a crybaby."**
5.  **The Wound (Shame & Confusion - Full Dysregulation):** 
    - Liska is hit with a double injury: the raw panic of her anxiety and the sharp sting of being shamed for it.
    - **Physical dysregulation:** The words sting like a wasp. A hot feeling of indignation flushes Liska’s face. The injustice of it all, on top of her own scary feelings, is too much.
    - Desperate need to find mom NOW
    - Overwhelmed by the confusing tangle of fear, hurt, and indignation, she turns and flees inside to find the safety of her mother.

### **Part 2: The Comfort & The Clue - A Mother's Redirection**

1.  **Setting:** Inside the house. Liska finds her mother, Mara, bursting with distress.
2.  **Full Co-Regulation Sequence:**
    - **The Complaint (Layer 1):** Liska wails, "Mama! The new kitten is all alone, his mommy is gone!"
    - **Co-regulation begins:** Mara immediately holds her, wrapping her in a warm, safe hug. (`Support: Calm Presence`, `Physical Contact`). She validates the feeling: **"Oh, my sweet. It is so frightening to think about being all alone. It's okay to feel scared about that."**
    - **The Complaint (Layer 2):** Feeling safe in her mother's embrace, Liska reveals the deeper hurt. "But... they *laughed* at me. They called me a crybaby."
    - **Deeper validation:** Mara holds her a little tighter. **"Oh. That must have hurt your feelings very much."**
3.  **The Transition (The Pivot):** Once Liska's breathing has steadied, Mara sees the opportunity to provide not just comfort, but understanding for Liska's intense feelings. She opens a door to a new perspective: **"Come with me. I want to show you something I've treasured since you were a brand new kitten."** Her tone is gentle and loving, creating a sense of significance.

### **Part 3: The Revelation - "You're Still You, and You're Treasured"**

1.  **Setting:** Liska's room. On a shelf sits a framed clay print of a tiny paw.
2.  **The Object:** Mara takes the print down. For Liska, it has always just been a decoration. She has never truly *seen* it.
3.  **The Discovery (Liska's Active Agency):**
    *   Mara shows her the baby print with love in her eyes: "This is your paw when you were just born. Look at this little shape in the middle. Do you see it?"
    *   Liska looks at the print, tracing the little heart shape in the clay. Then, she looks down at her own paw, turning it this way and that. She places her paw next to the print.
    *   **The Identification Moment:** Liska's eyes widen. It's a direct, physical match. She touches the clay print, then her own paw. **"I'm still like that! It's me!"** The discovery is tangible and deeply personal: the physical mark proves her nature is consistent.
    
4.  **The Cherishing (Mother's Key Message):**
    *   Mara smiles warmly. **"Exactly. When you were born and I saw this special heart, I treasured it. I knew you were my unique little kitten."**
    *   Liska looks up, her eyes questioning. "You... liked it?"
    *   **"I loved it,"** Mara confirms, touching Liska's current paw gently. **"And I love it now. You have always been my big-feelings kitten. We used to say it’s because you’re heart-shaped."**
    *   "Heart-shaped?" Liska whispers. 
    *   **"Yes. Big cries and big loves,"** Mara says softly. **"Some kittens have quieter feelings. Yours are strong. Both ways are good."**
    <!-- misses connection from feelings to metaphor. 5yo doesn't associate heart with feelings. -->
5.  **The Realization (Liska's Understanding):**
    *   Liska understands: She's always been this way - intensely feeling. And she's always been loved for it, not despite it.
    *   The "crybaby" insult loses its power because she now knows: She's not wrong or broken. She's herself, she's always been herself, and that self has always been treasured. She's heart-shaped.

### **Part 4: The Resolution - Coming Full Circle**

1.  **Setting:** Back in the backyard, later. Liska has returned to play.
2.  **The Test:** During play, another situation triggers a big feeling in Liska. Maybe she gets excited or worried about something. One of the kittens starts to say something mocking.
3.  **The New Response (Behavioral, Not Verbal):** 
    - Liska feels a flash of the old sting, but then she glances down at her paw—a quick, self-reassuring gesture.
    - She takes a breath.
    - With quiet confidence, she looks at the other kitten and says simply: **"No. I'm heart-shaped."** She shows her paw, not as a defense, but as a statement of fact.
4.  **The Shift:** The mocking kitten is confused but stops, their teasing deflated by Liska's firm, unexpected response. They look at her paw with curiosity rather than judgment.
5.  **The Integration:** Later, the mood shifts. Liska playfully presses her paw into a patch of soft dirt, leaving a perfect heart print. The other kittens, including the one who teased her, gather around. 

"Wow, a real heart!" one says. They take turns making their own paw prints next to hers, turning a symbol of shame into a game of shared, positive curiosity. Liska is still her intensely feeling self, but now she carries her identity with pride, not shame.
