For a 4-year-old, the sensory hierarchy for orientation and safety is primal and immediate. Their world is concrete. If something looks, sounds, or feels wrong, it *is* wrong.

Here is the breakdown of the most important senses for this narrative purpose, from most to least critical for orienting in a space.

### Tier 1: The Primary Senses for Orientation & Threat Detection

These are the senses a child uses to map their environment and detect changes or potential dangers from a distance. Disrupting these is the most effective way to make a familiar space feel unknown and threatening.

**1. Hearing (Auditory)**
This is arguably the most critical sense for a child's feeling of security in a space. Sound is omnidirectional and constant. A child cannot "close their ears" to a startling noise.
*   **How a child orients with it:** They rely on a familiar "soundscape": the specific pitch of their mother's voice, the sound of friends playing, the gentle hum of the community. These sounds signal "everything is normal."
*   **How to use it for disorientation:** Introduce a new sound that is either **intrusive** (a sudden, loud drum beat that makes her jump) or **overwhelming** (a cacophony of stranger's voices that drowns out the familiar sounds). If Liska can no longer pick out her mother's voice or her friends' laughter, she is auditorily lost. The world has become unpredictable noise.

**2. Sight (Visual)**
This is the primary sense for navigation and recognition. For a child, seeing is believing. If a familiar path or object looks different, it *is* different.
*   **How a child orients with it:** They navigate by landmarks (my house, the big tree, the slide). They feel safe when they can see their caregiver and their destination. A clear line of sight equals a safe path.
*   **How to use it for disorientation:** Don't just use darkness. Use **distortion** and **obstruction**.
    *   **Distortion:** The new festival lights create "shadow-snakes" on the ground, making the very path seem menacing and untrustworthy. The familiar tree now looks like a giant with wiggling arms.
    *   **Obstruction:** The crowd creates a "forest of legs." Liska can no longer see her mother *or* her friends. The path is physically and visually gone. This is a concrete, terrifying problem for a small child.

### Tier 2: The Senses of Proximity & Emotional State

These senses are less about orienting in the wider space and more about the child's immediate, personal bubble of safety. They are triggered by closeness.

**3. Touch (Tactile)**
Touch is the language of security. The entire conflict begins with Liska clinging to her mother's leg—a tactile anchor.
*   **How a child orients with it:** The feeling of a parent's hand, the familiar texture of their clothes, the warmth of their presence. This is the "home base" she must leave.
*   **How to use it for disorientation:** Contrast the secure feeling of holding on with the sensations of being alone: the cold breeze on her arms, the scratchy grass under her paws, the accidental, startling bump from a stranger's leg in the crowd. These sensations heighten her feeling of vulnerability.

**4. Smell (Olfactory)**
Smell is primal and deeply tied to memory and emotion. It bypasses rational thought.
*   **How a child orients with it:** The smell of "home"—damp earth, her mother's cooking, the flowers by the door. This olfactory bubble signals safety.
*   **How to use it for disorientation:** The familiar smell is gone, replaced by a new, sharp, or confusing one. The "smoky smell of roasting nuts" or the "strange, sweet perfume" of guests are alien. They signal that this is no longer her territory. It smells like a place for strangers.

**Conclusion:**

For maximum impact in making the yard feel unknown, you should prioritize disrupting **Hearing** and **Sight**. These are the senses Liska uses to understand and navigate her world. A sudden, loud sound or a path that looks like it's covered in wiggling snakes is a direct and concrete threat to a 4-year-old's sense of order. The loss of comforting touch and smells then reinforces the emotional consequence of that threat: feeling alone and vulnerable.
