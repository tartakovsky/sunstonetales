### Story Outline: Liska's Brave Steps

**1. The Setup: A Familiar World, Transformed**
- **Scene:** The Saar's central yard, a place Liska knows intimately from daily play, is transformed for the annual "Festival of First Bloom." It's twilight. Garlands of purple and orange lamps hang between the houses, casting a magical, festive glow that mixes with the dappled light from the yard's large trees. The air is a blend of smells: spices from the Market Gate, damp earth from the Jungle Gate, and salt from the Sea Gate.
<!-- Maybe different festival name which also works in Russian and that is somehow insteresting and related to the evening glow and beetleman. -->
- **Liska's State:** Liska is with her mother, Mara, feeling the happy buzz of the party but staying close to her "anchor." The familiar yard feels different tonight—exciting, but also crowded and louder than usual.
- **The Unfamiliar Element:** Near the large tree on the far side of the yard, a special guest for the festival, the Glow Beetle Man, is beginning his performance. A large, round blanket is spread on the grass where all the other cubs and kittens are gathering. While most attendees are neighbors, a few unfamiliar faces are scattered amongst them.
<!-- in setup, we lack reasons why all of it would make her anxious to explore alone. It's her familiar playground. It changed, yes. but we need something tangible and sensory and specifically makes her need to stay with her mom. What would trigger an anxiety like that in a usually familiar place? -->


**2. The Catalyst: The Moment of Wonder**
- **The Event:** The Glow Beetle Man begins his show. Using a low whistle, he coaxes a living nebula of deep violet and emerald beetles from his basket. This swirling cloud of light dances and spirals over the heads of the children on the blanket, painting their upturned faces in fleeting, magical shades.
- **The Pull:** Liska is utterly captivated. Then, with a final, soft note, the man guides a single, brilliant orange beetle—the brightest of the swarm—to separate from the cloud. It lands gently on another child's outstretched hand, pulsing with warm, soft light.
- **The Desire:** Liska sees the look of pure wonder on the child's face, illuminated by the beetle's personal glow. In that instant, a powerful desire crystallizes: she wants *that* feeling. She wants to be close to the magic. Her friends, already on the blanket, see her and wave, calling her to join them.

**3. The Conflict: Anxiety vs. Curiosity**
- **The Attempt:** Mara encourages her, "Go on, I see you love it. Go see." Driven by that intense desire, Liska lets go of Mara's hand and takes a step forward.
- **The Freeze:** Suddenly, the distance across the yard to the big tree feels like an epic expedition. The path is no longer just her familiar playground, but a social space dotted with friendly-but-unknown guests. The yard is now a space containing *unknowns*, and the journey feels fraught with a new kind of social complexity.
- **The Retreat:** A wave of separation anxiety overwhelms her powerful curiosity. The need for her safe anchor *in the presence of these unknowns* is stronger than the pull of the glowing beetle. She rushes back and clings to Mara's leg, "I can't go alone. You come with me."

**4. The Tool: The Story of a Name**
- **Validation:** Mara doesn't push. She kneels and hugs Liska, validating her feelings. "The yard feels different tonight, doesn't it? It's okay to feel anxious."
- **The Naming Story:** Mara tells Liska: "I want to tell you a story. Before you were born, we cared for a tiny, snow-white fox cub. He loved being with us; our laps were his favorite place. But he was also so curious about the big, rustling forest outside, full of new sounds and strange creatures he'd never met. He wanted to explore, but he also felt anxious leaving us. He learned that his curious feeling could be just a little bigger than his anxious feeling. He learned that **his bravery was what turned the unknown into the known.** When you were born, you were a tiny ball of white fur, just like him. So we named you Liska, which means 'little fox.' We knew one day you would be a brave little explorer, just like him."

**5. The Turning Point: A New Frame**
- **The Connection:** The story clicks for Liska. She sees the parallel: her safe spot with Mara is the den, the yard with its new faces is the forest, and she is the little fox cub whose mission is to turn the unknown into the known.
<!-- Would 4-5yo actually see the parallel? -->
- **The Shift:** The story reframes her anxiety. It's not a stop signal; it's a normal part of exploring. It gives her a mission: to be brave *like the fox*.
- **The Choice:** She processes this, looking from Mara to the distant, magical lights of the show. She lets go of Mara and says quietly, "The fox was brave. I am Liska. I can be like the fox."

**6. The Journey: The First Steps**
- **The Action:** She takes one deliberate step, then another. It's a "solo" journey.
The Journey: She walks across the Yard, her focus locked on the swirling lights. Her anxiety transforms into determined hope. She finds a spot among her friends and holds out her small hand.
<!-- - **Dissolving Fear:** As she walks, one of the "unfamiliar" guests (perhaps an old woman) gives her a gentle, brief smile. The "unknown" becomes "known and friendly." The anxiety lessens with each step, replaced by a growing feeling of pride. 

maybe, a moment like that can be used to nudge her towards final push to cross the yard. Should still keep her agency, e.g. she looks for something familiar or reassuring around the yard instead of looking at her mother. Finds it herself.

**7. The Resolution: Earned Joy**
- **Arrival:** She reaches her friends on the blanket, who welcome her into the group.
- **The Reward:** She is immediately immersed in the wonder of the glow beetle show. The beetle man, having seen her brave journey, smiles. When it's time, he signals her to open her paw and guides the brilliant orange beetle to land on her outstretched palm. Liska's face is lit with that look of awe she so desperately wanted. Her joy is doubled: it's the joy of the show, amplified by the pride of her own courage. The yard is hers again, but now her ownership of it feels deeper, earned by her bravery.

**8. The Integration: Sharing the Victory**
- **The Return:** After the show, she runs back to Mara, her face glowing.
- **The Declaration:** She doesn't just talk about the show. She says, "I was scared, but then I was curious. I took small steps... like the little fox."
- **Reinforcement:** Mara hugs her. "I'm so proud of my brave little Liska." The new skill and identity are affirmed.
