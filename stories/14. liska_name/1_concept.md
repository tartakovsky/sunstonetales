### Goal of the Story
This story teaches a child how to handle processing overwhelm when a familiar place is transformed and their internal map stops working. The character’s problem is that too many new sights, sounds, and bodies scramble orientation, leading to stop-and-go attempts, collisions, and retreat. The solution is a two-step approach: first, co-regulation with a caregiver that reduces input and restores rhythm; second, a personal identity anchor (the origin of the child’s name) that offers a concrete, relatable model for stepwise exploration. We present it through a gentle festival scene so the environment remains wondrous (not threatening), and we model practical tools: sensory shielding, short self-talk (“bit by bit”), small steps, and clear, respectful communication (“excuse me, please”). The why: to help a child translate curiosity into steady determination and regain agency in dynamic, crowded settings.

### Synopsis
In the yard during the Night of Twinkling Lights, the space Liska knows changes: lamps, shadows, and a “forest of legs” fill the paths. Music swells; the Glow Beetle Man’s living constellation rises. Curiosity pulls Liska forward, but the unfamiliar arrangement and a sudden loud laugh snap her out of flow. She tries again with a stop-and-go pattern, gets bumped, and retreats to Mara’s arms in full overwhelm—ears cupped, breath hitching, eyes sheltered until her world quiets enough to notice details again.

Once her rhythm returns, Mara shares the origin of Liska’s name: a little white fox who explored new places one careful pawstep at a time until curiosity guided the way. With this personal anchor and a simple phrase—“bit by bit”—Liska chooses steady steps back across the yard. When a tall figure blocks her path, she pairs her steps with assertive kindness: “Excuse me, please,” and the gap opens. She reaches the blanket, receives the warm landing of an orange beetle, and later shares fallen glow scales with other little ones, demonstrating ear-covering and her soft refrain: “bit by bit.” The festival remains big, but now it’s navigable.

### Detailed Q&A

1. Who are the main characters in the story?
- Liska; Mara (mother/caregiver); the Glow Beetle Man; Anji (peer); a tall festival-goer who briefly blocks the path; a younger kit Liska later helps.

2. What is the single problem the story will address?
- Processing overwhelm in a familiar place newly transformed by lights, sounds, and crowds, leading to lost internal mapping and approach-avoidance cycling.

3. What are the social consequences of this problem?
- Hesitation and retreat, missing shared moments with peers, difficulty moving through groups, feeling isolated while others participate; later, the resolution enables Liska to rejoin the group and to support another child.

4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?
- Co-regulation followed by stepwise self-regulation anchored in a personal name-story: reduce input and restore rhythm with a caregiver, then use “bit by bit” steps and clear “excuse me, please” navigation to cross the social space.

5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?
- Using short self-talk to structure graded exposure (“bit by bit”) while combining small steps, sensory shielding as needed, and simple, respectful communication to negotiate space.

6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?
- Using the Emotional Unfolding Sequence frame (signal → internal feeling → automatic coping → learned coping):
  - Signal: flinch, covering ears, contracting posture, scanning legs and shadows.
  - Internal: “too much input,” can’t track crickets or ground patterns, path obscured.
  - Automatic coping: stop-and-go; brief sprint; collision; fast retreat to caregiver.
  - Learned coping: co-regulation (pressure, muffled sound, matched breathing) → “bit by bit” self-talk, small steps, and “excuse me, please” to negotiate obstacles.
- Mapped metaphors that fit the arc: Confusion → Tangled Yarn (cognitive overload), Curiosity → Scout Bee (pull toward the beetles). A brief flight micro-response (Little Mouse) appears at retreat without becoming the subject of the story.

7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?
- The center is overload management, not an emotion showcase. Confusion/Tangled Yarn is functional to the skill; Curiosity/Scout Bee remains the motivational driver.

8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?
- Confusion → Tangled Yarn: the child’s cognitive map is scrambled by excess input and novel arrangements. Addressing Tangled Yarn developmentally prioritizes re-centering, simplifying input, and rebuilding a path via graded, repeatable steps tied to a personal identity anchor.

9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?
- Tangled Yarn (Запутанный Клубок) for cognitive overload. In-scene imagery supports it with the “forest of legs,” shifting shadows, and blended sounds that knot orientation.

10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?
- Simple Self-Talk (from Coping Strategies): a short, rhythmic phrase—“bit by bit”—paired with tiny, repeated steps. Alternatives considered:
  - Finger Count Calm: concrete pacing, but less socially active for moving through crowds.
  - Tell-Me-What’s-Happening: useful for explanations, but the scene needs movement skills.
  - Hold-Me-Tight: excellent for co-regulation, but not the child-led tool we want to install.
- Choice rationale: Simple Self-Talk integrates with graded exposure, supports autonomy in dynamic spaces, and scales alongside polite navigation (“excuse me, please”) without demanding high cognitive load.
