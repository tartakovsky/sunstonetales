Scaffolding (Home - The Naming Story): Mara cuddles Liska and says, "Let me tell you why we named you Liska. Before you were born, we cared for a tiny white fox cub, just as white as your fur. When it was time to explore the big forest, he felt sad to leave his den. But then he heard new sounds outside, and a curious feeling came. He took one small step, then another, and found wonderful things." Mara adds, "We named you Liska, our little fox, hoping you’d take small steps too."
Low Point (En Route - Hesitation): Liska starts toward the show but stops halfway, feeling that sad, heavy feeling. She looks back toward home, tempted to run to Mara.
Climax (New Place - Curiosity Wins): Liska hears laughter from other cubs in the meadow. Remembering the little fox, she feels a tiny curious spark. She takes one small step forward, then another.
Resolution (New Place - Success): Liska joins the cubs, participates in the show, and feels happy about the new experience. She thinks, "I did it, like the little fox."
Integration (Home - Return): Liska returns and tells Mara, "I felt anxious at first, but then I got curious, like the little fox." Mara says, "You took your small steps. I’m so proud of my Liska."

"Before you were born, we took care of a tiny white fox cub. When you were born, you were a tiny ball of white fur, just like him. So we named you Liska - it means 'little fox.'"

Liska lifted her head slightly, listening.

"That little fox grew bigger. One day, he wanted to explore the big forest. But he was scared to leave his warm, safe home." Mara stroked Liska's fur.
