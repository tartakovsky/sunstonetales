## Act 1: Introduction

## Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere - Revised

<!-- Establish Liska's normal navigation markers for this yard, then show the festival transformation. She notices changes but stays anchored to Mara - curious but cautious. -->

**Liska's Known Yard (brief)**

- The smooth stone path she races on every morning
- The soft grass where she plays
- The big tree where she climbs
- Evening cricket sounds

**What She Sees Now**

- Purple and orange lamps hanging everywhere
- A large round blanket spread under the big tree where cubs are gathering
- People standing where she usually runs
- Shadows moving in strange ways

**Her Current State**

- One paw holding Mara's skirt
- Watching the cubs on the blanket
- Wants to join them but feels unsure
- "Where did my yard go?"

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

## Beat 2.1: Lead-up - Final Revision

<!-- Changes intensifying but still manageable. She's noticing more disruptions but excitement about beetles competing with unease. -->

**Environmental Changes Intensifying**
- More people arriving, filling spaces
- Twilight deepening, shadows stranger
- Music getting louder
- Someone laughs suddenly nearby (small startle, recovers)

**The Pull of the Blanket**
- Anji waves from the blanket: "Liska! Over here!" 
- Cubs chattering excitedly about beetles
- The Glow Beetle Man walking toward the tree, carrying his basket
- Empty spot next to Anji waiting for her

**Liska's Response**
- Loosens grip on Mara's skirt slightly
- Half-step forward, then back
- Can't hear crickets anymore
- "Want to see... but everything's different"

---

## Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

<!-- Beetle show captures her attention enough to override minor discomfort. Desire pulls her forward. -->

**The Show Begins**
- The Glow Beetle Man lifts his whistle
- First low, haunting note silences everyone
- Living constellation emerges from basket
- Deep violet and emerald beetles swirling upward
- Lights pulsing in rhythm with the melody
- He directs them with graceful hand movements

**The Special Beetle**
- Single beetle glowing like tiny sun - brilliant orange
- Floats down to perch on lynx kitten's paw
- Bathes his face in warm light
- Everyone gasps in wonder

**Liska's Pull Forward**
- Heart beating fast with wanting
- Eyes locked on the glowing beetle
- Paws move on their own
- Takes one step, then another
- Nothing exists but that tiny sun

This keeps the magical quality of the catalyst while showing how it completely captures her attention, overriding her unease momentarily.

## Beat 2.3: The Core Incident - Simplified

<!-- Sudden loud laugh breaks her focus - she's spooked but NOT dysregulated. Quick return to Mara is precautionary, not panic. She recovers quickly. -->

**The Disruption**
- Takes her third step toward the blanket
- LOUD laugh erupts right beside her
- Sharp, sudden, unexpected
- Breaks the spell completely

**Immediate Response**
- Flinches hard
- Jumps back to Mara
- Presses against her leg again

**Quick Recovery**
- Takes a deep breath
- Looks back at the beetle show
- The orange beetle still glowing
- Still wants to touch it

That's it. Clean and simple. She's spooked, retreats, recovers, and is ready to try again.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

You're absolutely right. The research confirms the **stop-and-go pattern** is exactly what happens in approach-avoidance conflict. A 5-year-old under sensory pressure would:

## Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s) - Validated Structure

### First Attempt: **Stop-and-Go with Sensory Reduction**
This is the most developmentally accurate response:
- Covers ears (immediate reflex to "too loud")
- Takes 2-3 steps forward
- Stops, makes herself small (contracting body, hunching shoulders)
- Breathes/reorients
- Takes 2-3 more steps
- Stops again, maybe covers eyes briefly against the lights
- Continues this halting pattern

**Why this fails:** Someone bumps into her while she's contracted/stopped, or touches her shoulder when she can't hear them coming (ears covered), or she has to uncover to navigate around something and the full sensory blast hits her again.

### Second Attempt: **Panic Sprint**
After the stop-and-go fails, she's now:
- Already partially into the crowd (worst possible position)
- Frustration has depleted her regulation capacity
- Hyperfocuses on goal (tunnel vision on beetle/blanket)
- Attempts to power through with pure speed

**Why this fails:** Immediate collision with someone (she's not looking peripherally), or trips over something on the ground, or someone steps in her path. The physical impact plus being trapped in the crowd triggers full dysregulation.

### Then: **Flight Response**
- Immediate pivot and run back to Mara
- This is pure limbic system - no thought, just escape to safety

This sequence is supported by the research on approach-avoidance in preschoolers - they can typically handle 1-2 failed attempts before their fragile self-regulation collapses, especially under sensory pressure. The stop-and-go pattern is universal in young children facing overwhelming but desired goals.

## Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)

After the collision, full dysregulation hits:

**Immediate Physical Response:**
- Stumbles backward from impact
- Freezes for half-second (startle/shock)
- Then immediate flight to Mara
- Arms up "Pick me up!" while running
- Crashes into Mara's legs, climbing up her body

**Dysregulation Markers:**
- Heart pounding so hard she feels it in her chest
- Chest feels tight, can't get enough air
- Hands gripping/clawing at Mara's clothes
- Face pressed hard into Mara's shoulder/neck
- Full body tension - rigid against Mara

**Verbal Output (minimal, repetitive):**
- "Can't do it! Can't!"
- "Too loud, too loud!"
- "The ground is wrong!" (or whatever specific sensory complaint)
- Maybe just wordless crying/whimpering

**What She Can't Do:**
- Can't explain what happened coherently
- Can't look at the yard
- Can't process the beetle show still happening
- Can't respond to complex questions

She's now in pure survival mode - her nervous system is screaming "danger" and only Mara's body can regulate her. The specifics of what overwhelmed her (shadows/sounds/ground) come out as fragments, not explanations.

Looking at the sensory overload research and developmental patterns, here's what would be most realistic and recognizable for Beat 3.3:

## Beat 3.3: Recovery

**Mara's Immediate Physical Response:**
- Pulls Liska tight against her chest (deep pressure = calming)
- One hand cups over Liska's exposed ear (the one not pressed against Mara's body)
- Starts slow, rhythmic swaying (vestibular input for regulation)
- Maybe pulls her shawl/fabric over Liska's head to create a "cave" (blocks visual)

**Liska's Specific Complaints (fragmentary):**
- "The laughing is too loud!" (specific sound that triggered her)
- "Can't see the ground!" (the shadows/lights obscuring familiar paths)
- "Too many voices all mixing!" (auditory processing overload)
- Or simply: "Hurts! Hurts!" (pointing at ears/eyes)

**Mara's Validation (simple, specific):**
- "The laughing was very loud." (names the trigger)
- "Too many sounds all at once." (validates the overwhelm)
- "Hard to see with all the lights moving." (acknowledges visual confusion)
- "Your ears hurt. I'm covering them." (names sensation + solution)

**Physical Regulation Sequence:**
1. First 30 seconds: Just holding, swaying, muffling sound
2. Liska's breathing starts to slow
3. Mara might hum low and steady (single tone, predictable)
4. Liska's grip loosens slightly
5. Maybe Mara breathes deeply, exaggerated, so Liska feels it and matches

**Transition to Cognitive:**
- Liska (muffled): "Can't hear the crickets"
- Mara: "The music is covering them up"
- Liska: "Want the crickets back"
- Mara: "The crickets are still there, just hiding under the loud sounds"

This gives the child reader a toolkit: cover ears when too loud, hide face when too bright, get squished when overwhelmed. The "crickets still there, just hiding" is concrete enough for a 5-year-old while being reassuring - the familiar hasn't disappeared, it's just temporarily masked.

The key is that Mara doesn't try to convince Liska it's not overwhelming - she agrees it IS too much and provides physical solutions first, words second.

Based on the research, you're correct in your analysis. Here's what the evidence shows:

## Recovery Timeline for Sensory Overload (Not Fear-Based)

**Key Finding:** Recovery from sensory overload meltdown is typically **20+ minutes** after stressor removal, but this is for FULL meltdowns. For the level of dysregulation Liska experiences (not a complete meltdown, more of an overwhelm episode), recovery would be faster - likely **3-5 minutes** with proper co-regulation.

**Critical Distinction:** You're absolutely right that this is **processing overwhelm, not fear**. The research confirms:
- Sensory overload = nervous system cannot process incoming data
- Fear = anticipation of danger
- Liska's issue = "I can't handle all this input" NOT "The yard will hurt me"

## Beat 3.4: Solution Discovery - Timing and Cognitive Load

Given a 3-5 minute recovery with effective co-regulation, here's the realistic progression:

**Time markers to show passage:**
- Physical cue: "Liska's breathing had slowed to match Mara's"
- Environmental cue: "The beetle show's music had changed to a gentler tune"
- Body cue: "Her fingers, which had been gripping so tight, relaxed"

**Cognitive readiness indicators before story:**
- She's no longer hiding her face
- Can track visual input again (watches a beetle fly past)
- Asks a question (shows prefrontal cortex back online)
- Maybe: "Why is everything different, Mama?" (seeking understanding, not expressing distress)

**The Story Timing:**
The fox story works here because:
1. She's regulated but still on Mara's lap (physical security maintained)
2. Her cognitive processing is back but she hasn't yet attempted re-engagement
3. She needs a bridge between "I failed" and "I could try again"
4. The story provides framework without demanding immediate action

**Why This Works Developmentally:**
- After co-regulation, a 5-year-old can handle narrative processing
- The story doesn't require her to DO anything yet
- It plants a seed rather than pushing action
- She has time to integrate the metaphor while still physically safe

The key is that by the time Mara starts the story, Liska is:
- Physically calm
- Emotionally regulated
- Cognitively capable
- But NOT yet ready to act independently

This creates the perfect window for the fox metaphor to land as inspiration rather than pressure. She can process "I'm like a brave fox" while still in the safety of Mara's arms, building internal resources before the next attempt.

## Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

**Decision moment:** Liska, still on Mara's lap but calm now, watches the glowing beetles circle. "Mama," she says, "I want to try. Like the little fox - bit by bit." This shows the story has landed and she's ready to attempt again with a strategy.

**Physical separation with connection:** She slides down from Mara's lap, taking a moment to find her balance. Looks up at Mama one more time. Mara nods, maybe touches her own heart in encouragement.

**Movement with sensory awareness:** Liska begins with small, careful steps. The voices seem louder without Mama's arms around her, the ground feels strange under her paws, but she keeps going. As she walks, she whispers "Little bit, bit by bit," and by the third step it becomes a soft, sing-song rhythm that matches her movement.

**Challenge and self-regulation:** A sudden loud laugh (the same sound that spooked her before) makes her freeze mid-step. She recognizes it: "That laugh again." But instead of running back, she stops, takes a breath like Mama showed her - in and out - then returns to her refrain: "Bit by bit, little bit by bit."

When she starts walking and creates her refrain:

"Bit by bit, like the little fox did" - this connects her strategy directly to the story, making it feel earned rather than random. It shows she internalized the lesson.

**Maintained tether while progressing:** She looks back at Mama (who maybe mouths the words with her), then forward at the blanket where the beetles glow, then continues her careful journey, using her song as a bridge between safety and desire.

This beat shows her using learned strategies (breathing, refrain) to manage unchanged sensory challenges while maintaining connection to her secure base.

You're absolutely right. Let me fix that:

## Beat 4.2: Minor Setback

**The Obstacle:**
- Someone steps into her path (could be anyone - adult legs blocking her way)
- Maybe they're talking to another adult, not even noticing her
- Or reaching for something on a table, arm across her path
- She's small, they don't see her

**The Overwhelm Moment:**
- Her refrain stops: "Bit by bit, little b—"
- She's blocked, can't see how to go around
- More people close in from sides (not intentionally, just crowd movement)
- Her breathing quickens

**The Stuck Feeling:**
- Can't go forward (blocked)
- Won't go backward (came so far already)
- Looks back - Mama's face is hard to see through all the people
- Looks forward - can't see clear path
- Maybe puts hands over ears briefly (crowd noise building)
- The refrain isn't solving THIS problem

**Internal State:**
- Not full dysregulation but climbing toward it
- "Too many legs, too many people"
- Frozen in place
- Her strategy worked for walking but not for navigating obstacles

This is the pure setback - she's overwhelmed by being trapped in the crowd, her refrain can't fix a physical blockage, and she's stuck between retreat and advance.


## Beat 4.3: Persistence (simplified)

**The Visual Pull:**
- The Glow Beetle Man plays a particularly beautiful trill
- The orange beetle rises up above the crowd, pulsing brighter
- Liska's eyes lock onto it through all the people
- "The beetle..." (whispered, longing)

**First Attempt:**
- Takes breath like Mama showed her
- "Excuse me" (too quiet, lost in crowd noise)
- The person doesn't hear, doesn't move
- Nothing happens

"The fox kept trying" - simple, present-tense self-talk when she needs to try the louder "excuse me." Not analytical, just a quick reminder that persistence is part of the pattern.

**The Brave Second Try:**
- She realizes they can't hear her
- Reaches up (has to stretch) to touch the person's arm/clothing
- "Excuse me, please!" (louder, while tugging)

**The Path Opens:**
- The person looks down, surprised
- "Oh! Didn't see you there, little one"
- Steps aside, maybe guides another person aside too
- The path opens

**Success and Movement:**
- She whispers "Thank you"
- Starts her refrain again: "Bit by bit, little bit"
- Moves forward through the gap

This shows a clear two-step escalation: quiet voice (fails) → touch + louder voice (succeeds). The physical contact with a stranger while speaking up is the brave persistence moment.

Yes, that sequence is excellent! Let me verify the order flows naturally:

## Beat 4.4: Success (Final Sequence)

1. **Arrival:** Final steps to blanket edge
2. **Friends' welcome:** Anji: "Liska! You made it!" (others scoot to make room)
3. **Physical collapse:** Drops onto blanket, tumbles onto her side (full release)
4. **Recovery sit-up:** Cutely pushes herself back up to sitting
5. **Seeking witness:** Looks back through crowd to find Mara
6. **Celebration:** Mara claps her hands (public acknowledgment)
7. **Response:** Liska waves back (connection confirmed)
8. **Transition:** Turns back to the show
9. **Final release:** Deep exhale, shoulders drop, fully relaxes

**Why This Order Works:**

- **Friends first** provides immediate social safety to enable collapse
- **Collapse before looking for Mara** shows her body trusted the environment
- **Sitting up before seeking Mara** shows she's orienting herself
- **Mara's clapping** arrives just when Liska needs confirmation
- **Wave back** completes the celebration loop
- **Turning to show THEN exhaling** means she's finally, truly settled

The "tumble onto side then cutely sit up" is particularly strong - it shows both the genuine exhaustion and the resilient bounce-back that's so characteristic of this age. The deep exhale at the very end (not beginning) shows she's finally released all the tension.

Perfect emotional arc from arrival through complete settling.

## Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief

**The Beetle Approaches:**
The Glow Beetle Man catches Liska's eye from across the circle - he's been watching her journey. He smiles, winks, and plays a special trill on his whistle. The brilliant orange beetle that had been hovering above the crowd circles once, twice, then begins its descent toward the blanket.

**Physical Preparation:**
Liska's eyes go wide. Without thinking, she cups her paws together, creating a small landing spot. She holds perfectly still except for the slight trembling of excitement. Around her, the other cubs whisper: "It's coming to Liska!" But she barely hears them.

**The Landing:**
The beetle settles into her cupped paws with surprising gentleness. Warm! The unexpected heat spreads through her paw pads and up her arms. Its glow paints her gray fur golden-orange, pulsing steadily like a tiny heartbeat. She can feel its delicate feet, the slight flutter of wings folding.

**The Moment of Wonder:**
Everything else fades - the crowd noise, the other cubs, even the rest of the show. Just her and this living light. "So warm," she whispers. The beetle's antennae wave gently, as if greeting her. Then the thought blooms in her mind: "I got my beetle... like the fox got his butterfly." The parallel completes itself, simple and satisfying.

**The Release:**
After several long breaths, the beetle lifts from her paws. She doesn't grab or try to keep it - she knows it needs to return to its family. Her paws still glow faintly with residual light, and she stares at them in wonder, turning them over to see the golden shimmer.

**Connection with Mara:**
She looks across the crowd to find Mara, needing to share this magic. She holds up her still-glowing paws so Mara can see. Mara presses her paw to her heart." Liska presses her own glowing paw to her chest, feeling the warmth spread there too, completing the circle of connection.

Looking at the research on sensory processing recovery and child development patterns, here's what Beat 5.1 should contain:

## Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning

**The Return and Settling:**
- Liska walks back to Mara (purposeful, not running)
- Sits beside her (leaning against her side, not on lap)
- "Mama, the beetle was so warm!" or "It tickled my paws!"

**Mara's Simple Acknowledgment:**
- "You walked all that way"
- "Through all those people"
- "Even when it was hard"

**Liska's Excited Retelling:**
- "I said 'excuse me' but they didn't hear me!"
- "So I touched their arm like this—" (demonstrates)
- "And said it REALLY LOUD!"
- "Then they moved!"
- "And the beetle came to ME!"

That's the complete beat - physical return, simple wonder about the beetle, Mara's concrete acknowledgment of what Liska accomplished, and then Liska's excited sequential retelling of her problem-solving moment. The excitement in her voice and the physical demonstration ("like this") show she's fully integrated the experience as a success.

This follows the research showing that 5-year-olds process overwhelming experiences through:
1. Physical reconnection with caregiver (but not clinging)
2. Concrete sensory observations ("warm," "tickled")
3. Sequential retelling of events
4. Physical reenactment of key moments

The beat ends with her triumph ("the beetle came to ME!") which connects her effort to her reward without requiring abstract reasoning about bravery or courage.

## Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo

**Recognition of Others' Struggle:**
As families began gathering their things, Liska noticed something she hadn't before. She hadn't been the only one who felt overwhelmed. The yard was full of other little ones clinging to their parents, overwhelmed by the festival's bigness. She remembered how alone she'd felt when everything was too much.

**The Sharing Impulse:**
Quietly, she began collecting the glow beetle scales that had fallen on the blanket - tiny points of fading light. She padded over to a young kit who was crying softly against his father's leg and held out a scale.

**The Exchange:**
"Everything's too much? Here, beetle left this for you."

The kit looked at her with wide, teary eyes, then reached out a shaky paw and took the scale. "Thank you," he whispered.

"When it got too loud, I went like this—" Liska covered her ears and demonstrated tiny steps. "—little bit by little bit. Little ones can do it!"

The kit watched her demonstration, still clutching the glowing scale. His tears had stopped.



## Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
"Liska," she thought. "Like the little fox."

As she walked home with Mara, she kept humming: "Little bit by little bit, little ones can do it..."
