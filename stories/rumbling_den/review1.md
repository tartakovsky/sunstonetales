# Story Structure Audit: "Rumbling Den"

This document provides a detailed audit of the story sequence for "Rumbling Den," validating its alignment with the project's psychological, narrative, and character guidelines.

## Overall Assessment

The emotional and narrative sequence for "Rumbling Den" is logically sound, developmentally appropriate, and structurally robust. It correctly follows the 5-act structure, implements emotional slots and triggers accurately, and aligns with the key principles of developmental psychology outlined in the project guidelines. The emotional arc from confusion to resolution is clear and serves the central theme of a child navigating parental conflict.

## Act 1: Setup

### Location: 1.1 Playful Start & 1.2 Happy Baseline

*   **Expectation:** The story should begin by establishing a normal, positive baseline for the character in their environment, as per `@five_act_4_to_6_yo.md` (Act 1).
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** The sequence begins with Liska in a state of `Joy` and `Contentment`, playing in a safe, familiar space ("sunny corner of the den"). This effectively establishes her initial happy state before the inciting incident.

## Act 2: Inciting Incident

### Location: 2.1 Discovery of Tension & 2.2 Initial Reaction

*   **Expectation:** A clear, tangible problem should be established that triggers an initial negative emotional reaction, as per `@five_act_4_to_6_yo.md` (Act 2.3, 2.4).
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** The problem is Liska observing her parents' argument. The emotional trigger is correctly identified as `Goal Obstruction` (her goal to understand/connect is blocked), leading to `Confusion`. This is a developmentally appropriate reaction for a 4-6 year old who cannot process the complexity of the adult situation.

*   **Expectation:** The emotional progression should be logical and consistent with `@emotional_metaphors.md`.
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** The progression from `Confusion` to `Fear` is psychologically sound. The use of the `Tangled Yarn (Запутанный Клубок)` metaphor for `Confusion` is correctly implemented and serves as the single, focused metaphor for the story. The `Uncertainty in safety` slot correctly captures the trigger for her fear.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve

### Location: 3.1 Attempt 1 & 3.2 Co-Regulation Scene

*   **Expectation:** The character should make an initial, less-considered attempt to solve the problem, and an adult should provide co-regulation rather than an immediate solution, as per `@five_act_4_to_6_yo.md` (Act 3.2) and `@developmental_guidelines.csv` ("Child Agency instead of Adult Solutions", "Co-regulation instead of Self-regulation").
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** Liska's first attempt (showing her shell) is simple and fails, leading to `Sadness` from `Emotional Disconnection`. Father Daric's response is a model implementation of co-regulation. He uses `Emotional Validation` (a valid type from `@support_types.csv`) to acknowledge her feelings and provide reassurance ("we still love you") without dismissing her concern or instantly fixing the core problem. This respects the guideline to treat feelings as valid and avoids premature problem-solving.

*   **Expectation:** Character actions must align with their profiles.
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** Father Daric's calm, explanatory approach is perfectly in line with his profile as "patient, protective, teaches through stories" and "Always ready to explain."

### Location: 3.4 Low Point

*   **Expectation:** The character should reach a low point with intense negative emotion after a more significant setback, as per `@five_act_4_to_6_yo.md` (Act 3.4).
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** Seeing her mother crying is a significant escalation. The subsequent emotion is correctly identified as `Helplessness`, triggered by `Performance Failure` (her inability to fix the situation). Her retreat to "curl into a ball" is a strong, recognizable auto-coping behavior.

## Act 4: Climax

### Location: 4.1 Finding Solution & 4.2 Final Attempt

*   **Expectation:** The child should be the primary agent in discovering the solution, reflecting the "Child Agency" principle from `@developmental_guidelines.csv`.
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** The sequence specifies that Liska herself remembers a happy family picture and decides to use it to bridge the gap. The solution—verbal expression of feelings and reminding her parents of their bond—is discovered and initiated by her. This is a powerful demonstration of child agency.

*   **Expectation:** The solution should be psychological/emotional, not magical, and should be applied by the character, as per `@developmental_guidelines.csv` ("Process Focus instead of Magical Solutions").
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** The solution is not an external tool but an internal, emotional one: communication. Liska actively implements this by bringing the picture and speaking her feelings, demonstrating growth.

## Act 5: Resolution

### Location: 5.1 Connection, 5.2 Celebration, 5.3 Lesson

*   **Expectation:** The resolution should reinforce the lesson learned and show the character integrating their new understanding, as per `@five_act_4_to_6_yo.md` (Act 5.2, 5.3).
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** The family reconnects physically and emotionally. The lesson that "family dens rumble, but love is stronger than arguments" is a key takeaway. This reframes the scary event into a learning opportunity, aligning with the "Learning Frame instead of Shame Language" guideline from `@developmental_guidelines.csv`.

*   **Expectation:** The ending should show a "New Status Quo" where the character is more emotionally intelligent.
    *   **Fulfilled:** Yes.
    *   **Implementation:** Liska doesn't just return to the baseline; she now has a new understanding of parental emotions and conflict. She has successfully navigated a complex emotional situation and has a new tool (expressing her feelings to connect) for the future.
