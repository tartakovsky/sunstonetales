**1. Who are the main characters in the story?**  
**A:** Liska (protagonist), Mother (Mara Kotichek, supporting character), Father (Daric Kotichek, supporting character)

---

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** Liska feels confused and sad when she sees her parents arguing and not interacting warmly with each other or with her.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** Liska feels isolated and worried that her parents might be upset with her too, creating a sense of emotional disconnection within the family.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** Liska learns to express her feelings and remind her parents of their family bond, helping them reconnect and reassure her of their love.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** Liska practices using her words to express her feelings and needs by saying, 'We are family. Remember that we love each other. I love both of you. I want both of you to be together with me.'

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  
**A:**
- Disappointment -> Sadness: When Liska tries to engage her father with her shell and he responds distantly.
- Confusion -> Fear: When Liska sees her parents' tense behavior and worries they might be mad at her too.
- Sadness -> Helplessness: When Liska sees her mother's wet fur and curls into a ball, feeling unable to help.

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** Sadness is central as the story focuses on Liska learning to manage it by expressing her feelings and seeking family connection.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** Sadness (resulting from Disappointment and Confusion) - It's critical for 4-6-year-olds to learn to handle sadness to build emotional resilience and prevent prolonged negativity after family tension.  
**Comments:** Two options from the raw input are considered: Sadness and Fear. Sadness is developmentally significant as it addresses the core feeling of disconnection and isolation Liska experiences, which is common in young children witnessing parental conflict. Fear, while present as a worry about being the cause of the argument, is secondary and less central to the narrative resolution. Sadness is chosen as it aligns with the story's focus on reconnection and emotional expression. If another emotion like Helplessness seems more fitting, it could be considered, but Sadness encapsulates the broader emotional journey in this context.

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** Sadness is visualized as a 'Rainy Cloud' (Дождливая Тучка) hanging over Liska, making everything grey and heavy. (Sourced from @emotional_metaphors.md)  
**Comment:** This metaphor is chosen for the main emotion of Sadness as per the input guidelines.

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** Liska learns to walk over to her parents and use her words: 'We are family. Remember that we love each other. I love both of you. I want both of you to be together with me.' to express her sadness and need for connection, seeking reassurance. (Sourced from @emotion_unfolding_sequence.md under Sadness and adapted to story context)  
**Comments:** Two options are considered: 1) 'Talking About My Feeling' from @coping_strategies.csv, which encourages verbal expression of emotions, critical for young children to learn as a way to seek support; 2) 'Hold-Me-Tight' for physical comfort, also important but less aligned with the story's resolution of active reconnection. The first option is chosen as it fits the narrative of Liska taking initiative to bridge the emotional gap, which is developmentally significant for building communication skills. If another strategy like 'My Special Comfort Item' were more fitting, it could be suggested, but verbal expression aligns best with the story's resolution.

**11. Write a paragraph summarizing the story.**  
**A:** In 'Rumbling Den,' Liska starts her morning happily arranging her shell collection in the family den, but soon notices her parents, Mara and Daric, acting distant and tense with each other. Feeling a heavy 'Rainy Cloud' of sadness, her attempts to engage them fail, deepening her confusion and worry that she might be the cause. At her lowest point, seeing her mother's sadness, Liska feels helpless, but then remembers their family bond. She bravely takes their hands and expresses her love and need for togetherness, helping her parents soften and apologize. They reconnect with a special family gesture, returning to their sunny corner, teaching Liska that family love endures even through arguments, and that expressing feelings can mend emotional rifts.
