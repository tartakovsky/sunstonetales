**A:** Liska Koticheck (protagonist), Daric Koticheck (father), Mara Koticheck (mother), Tahrra (friend), Kashassi tooth-healer, A scared young Kashassi cub

---

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** Liska experiences fear and anxiety about visiting the tooth-healer after cracking her tooth during a game.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** Liska's fear isolates her momentarily as she struggles to admit the issue, potentially delaying necessary medical care and affecting her interactions with family and friends.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** Liska learns to manage her fear by using a comfort object (courage stone) and a courage phrase, ultimately finding inner bravery by helping another scared cub.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** Liska practices a ritual of holding her courage stone, taking three deep breaths, and repeating a courage phrase like 'Face the fear, find the clear!' to manage anxiety.

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  
**A:**
- Fear -> Freeze Response: When Liska realizes she needs to visit the tooth-healer after cracking her tooth.
- Fear -> Flight Response: Initial instinct to hide the problem or avoid confrontation with the situation.

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** Fear is central as the story focuses on Liska learning to manage and overcome her anxiety about medical procedures.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** Fear - It's critical for 4-6-year-olds to learn to handle fear, especially related to medical procedures, to build trust in healthcare and develop coping mechanisms for anxiety.  
**Comments:** Two options from the input are Fear and Sadness. Fear is developmentally significant as it addresses a common childhood anxiety around medical visits, fostering resilience and trust. Sadness could be relevant if focusing on the loss of comfort due to pain, but it is secondary in this narrative as the primary struggle is overcoming fear. I choose Fear as it aligns with the story's core challenge and developmental priority for this age group.

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** Fear will be visualized as the 'Icicle (Сосулька)' metaphor for the freeze response, representing paralyzing fear.  
**Comment:** This metaphor is sourced from `emotional_metaphors.md` and fits the narrative of Liska feeling frozen by her fear of the tooth-healer.

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** Liska learns to use a comfort object (courage stone) combined with a ritual of deep breathing and repeating a courage phrase like 'Face the fear, find the clear!' to manage her fear.  
**Comments:** Two options from coping strategies are 'My Special Comfort Item' and 'Simple Self-Talk'. 'My Special Comfort Item' is developmentally significant as it provides a tangible tool for self-soothing, crucial for young children. 'Simple Self-Talk' supports emotional articulation and reinforcement of bravery, also key for this age. I choose the combination of both as they work synergistically in the story, with the comfort item sourced from `coping_strategies.csv` and adapted to Liska's narrative in `outline.md`. If a different strategy is preferred, 'Finger Count Calm' could be an alternative for its simplicity in managing fear, but the comfort item aligns better with the story's magical element.

**11. Write a paragraph summarizing the story.**  
**A:** Liska, a young snow leopard, cracks her tooth while playing a daring game with her friend Tahrra at the beach, sparking intense fear about visiting the tooth-healer. Initially, she struggles with anxiety, feeling frozen like an 'Icicle', but her parents support her by introducing a magical courage stone enchanted by her father to vibrate soothingly. Through practicing a ritual of deep breathing and repeating a courage phrase, Liska builds her bravery. At the tooth-healer's, she encounters a scared Kashassi cub and decides to go first to show it's not frightening, discovering her inner strength. The tooth-healer fixed her tooth gently, and Liska shared her reward with the cub, reinforcing that true courage comes from within and grows by helping others.
