# Psychological Framework: From Purr to Growl

---

### **Framework 1: Psychological Analysis (The "Why")**

**Core Emotion:** Indignation (Righteous Anger)
This emotion is triggered by the perceived injustice of a boundary violation. Liska's personal space and creative work—an extension of her inner world—are carelessly violated by Anji. This isn't simple anger; it's a "hot," righteous feeling born from unfairness, which is developmentally critical for learning self-advocacy.

**Primary Drivers:**
1.  **Violation of Personal & Creative Space:** Anji's sudden physical touch and the subsequent destruction of the drawing represent a profound intrusion. For a child, creative work is deeply personal, and its violation feels like a personal attack.
2.  **Loss of Agency:** The event happens *to* Liska without her consent, stripping her of control over her environment and creations. This powerlessness fuels an intense need to reassert control, which initially manifests as a dysregulated, aggressive outburst.
3.  **Perceived Unfairness:** From Liska's perspective, her focused, positive activity was disrupted by Anji's carelessness. This stark contrast between her actions and the negative outcome is the foundation of her indignation.

**Secondary Drivers:**
1.  **Interruption of a Flow State:** Liska was in a state of joyful concentration ("purring"). The jarring interruption is neurologically dysregulating.
2.  **Startle Response:** Anji's sudden appearance activates a physiological fight-or-flight response, priming her for an intense emotional reaction before her cognitive brain can catch up.
3.  **Developmental Egocentrism:** Liska is primarily focused on her own experience of hurt and injustice. She doesn't yet have the capacity to easily differentiate Anji's lack of negative intent from the negative impact of his actions.

### **Framework 2: The Child's Subjective Experience (The "What")**

*(Written from the child's perspective)*

**Immediate Response (First Seconds):**
- "Jump!"
- "My picture!"
- "No!"
- "Get back!"
- "Stare with big eyes."

**Primary Feelings (What Overwhelms Them):**
- "It's not fair!"
- "He wrecked it!"
- "That's MINE!"
- "Feel hot, hot, HOT!"
- "Don't touch me!"

**Physical Sensations (How Their Body Feels):**
- "Face hot."
- "Body tight."
- "Tail poof!"
- "Want to push."
- "Grrr sound inside."

**Secondary Reactions (After Initial Response):**
- "He's not careful!"
- "Why did he do that?"
- "I'm going to cry."
- "Go away, Anji!"
- "I need Papa now."

**What They Notice (Environmental Awareness):**
- "The big wet spot."
- "My drawing's colors are all running."
- "The paper is ripped."
- "Anji's big paw so close."
- "Papa is my safe place."

**Summary:** The progression moves from a shocked, physical freeze to a hot, explosive outburst ("get away!"), followed by the overwhelming hurt of the loss ("my picture is ruined!") and a retreat to a trusted adult for safety and comfort.

### **Framework 3: Narrative Implementation (The "How")**

**Environmental Description Setup:**
- *The garden was not quiet and happy anymore.*
- *A big, dark puddle spread over the drawing. The colors got wet and mixed together.*
- *Anji was suddenly right there, his face too close.*
- *The wet paper tore with a soft, sad sound.*
- *The air felt hot and stuffy.*

**Character's Physical Experience:**
- *Her cheeks felt hot.*
- *Her tail puffed up and went stiff and straight.*
- *A low, grumpy growl came from her throat.*
- *Her whole body felt tight and hard.*
- *She squeezed her paws into fists.*

**Character's Thoughts/Words (Age-Appropriate):**
- *A thought popped in her head, hot and fast: 'It's mine!'*
- *'His paw shouldn't be there!'*
- *'Stop!'*
- *'My drawing is all wet and broken!'*
- *'Papa!'*

**Showing Internal State Through Action:**
- *She froze and didn't move. She just stared at the spreading puddle.*
- *She swiped a paw toward Anji; her claws caught the wet drawing, tearing it with a soft rip.*
- *She turned and ran, her paws hitting the ground hard as she went to find Papa.*
- *She held the two torn pieces of her drawing.*
- *The next day, she put her paws down firmly on the ground before she talked.*

**Sensory Vocabulary (Prioritized for this emotion):**
- **Primary words:** Hot, tight, stiff, sharp, loud, fast, big.
- **Supporting words:** Wet, messy, wrong, broken, shaky, close, gone.

**Key Narrative Techniques:**
1.  **Somatic Focus:** Describe the direct physical feelings of indignation (hot cheeks, tight body, puffed tail). The "Wildfire" metaphor is a tool for the parents to *explain* the feeling to the child later, not for the child's initial, raw experience.
2.  **Pacing Contrast:** Show the slow, happy, quiet time. Then, make everything happen fast and loud when Anji arrives. This change in speed shows the shock.
3.  **Action as Expression:** Use simple, clear actions—freezing, growling, swiping, running—to show how Liska feels before she has the words for it.
4.  **Problem Re-enactment & Scaffolding:** Show Liska failing the first time, then learning from her parents, then trying again. This shows the reader how to learn a new skill step-by-step.
5.  **Progression Pattern:** The emotional arc is **Violation -> Raw Reaction (Push/Cry) -> Co-regulation & Learning Words -> Trying Again -> Skilled Action (Using Words) -> Friendship is Okay Again**.
