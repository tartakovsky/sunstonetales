# Initial Q&A for Story Specification

**Note:** The answers provided below are not final and are intended as examples of the type of information that should be provided for a specific book.

You MUST read every file in the input list before respoding. Load it all into your context.

**Required Input List:**
- **Universal Input:**
  - Emotional Metaphors: [emotional_metaphors.md](mdc:context/emotional_metaphors.md)
  - Emotion Unfolding Sequence: [emotion_unfolding_sequence.md](mdc:context/emotion_unfolding_sequence.md)
  Strategies: [coping_strategies.csv](mdc:context/slots/coping_strategies.csv)
- **Character-Specific Input, e.g. for Liska:**
  - Emotional Tells: [emotional_tells.md](mdc:context/characters/Liska/emotional_tells.md)
  - Auto-Coping Behaviors: [auto_coping.md](mdc:context/characters/Liska/auto_coping.md)
  - Learned Coping Strategies: [learned_coping.md](mdc:context/characters/Liska/learned_coping.md)

Your job is to not only sort through what's in the input, but also to correct it and bring it closer to reality. E.g. if the input only mentions the character to be sad, but the actual emotion set would be more complex / different, it is your job to identify the set of actual emotions that would happen in such context. Then when you choose the most important emotions and how they unfold, you must choose from that list of actual emotions, not only from what's in the input.

**1. Who are the main characters in the story?**  
**A:** Liska (protagonist), Tahrra (friend), Lucia (friend), and Mara (supporting character).

---

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** When Liska gets frustrated, she screams demands instead of asking for help, which pushes her friends away and prevents them from solving problems together.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** Her friends feel hurt and scared. Tahrra, who is sensitive to noise, withdraws emotionally and physically. Lucia, who doesn't understand the language well, feels the anger and backs away. This ruins their shared activity and damages their trust in Liska.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** Liska learns to communicate her needs calmly and respectfully by considering her friends' feelings (The Golden Rule), even when she is frustrated.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** Liska learns to pause when feeling frustrated, take deep breaths to calm down, and then use "I" statements to express her feelings and ask for help as part of a team (e.g., "I feel worried... What do you think we should do?").

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  

**A:** 
- **Frustration -> Anger:** Liska's impatience with her friends' pace builds into an angry outburst when she fears losing the treasure.
- **Hurt (Liska) -> Anger (Liska):** When Lucia accidentally breaks a crayon, Liska's initial feeling of loss quickly turns into anger.
- **Anger (Liska) -> Fear (Tahrra):** Liska's screaming causes Tahrra to become fearful and withdraw.

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** Frustration and its escalation into Anger are central. The story's main plot revolves around Liska learning to manage these feelings and their outward expression to achieve a social goal (cooperating with friends).

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** Anger.
**Comments:**
*   **Anger:** This is the most critical emotion to address. Liska's problem isn't just feeling frustrated; it's that her frustration escalates into angry screaming that harms her friendships. For a 4-6-year-old, learning to manage the *expression* of anger is a fundamental social-emotional skill. The story directly tackles the consequences of this expression and teaches a pro-social alternative via the "Golden Rule."
*   **Frustration:** While frustration is the trigger, it's a precursor. The story's conflict and resolution hinge on what Liska *does* with her frustration. By focusing on Anger, we address the behavioral outcome that causes the social breakdown, which is the core of the story's lesson.

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** Anger will be visualized as the **Little Volcano (Вулканчик)** metaphor. (Sourced from `emotional_metaphors.md`)  

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** The "Spot, Stop, Shift" technique. Liska learns to **spot** the feeling of frustration building up (her inner "Little Volcano"), **stop** before she screams, and **shift** her actions by taking deep breaths, relaxing her body, and changing her words from demands to collaborative questions.
**Comments:** This technique is explicitly mentioned in the story's input and serves as the core learned skill. It combines internal state awareness ("spot"), impulse control ("stop"), and behavioral change ("shift"). While it leads to better communication similar to the "My 'I Need Help' Plan," "Spot, Stop, Shift" is the specific name of the process Liska uses. It directly addresses the primary problem of managing the escalation from frustration to a damaging angry outburst by providing a memorable, actionable three-step process for the child to learn.

**11. Write a paragraph summarizing the story.**
**A:** Liska, Tahrra, and Lucia's treasure hunt is derailed when rising tides threaten their prize. Overwhelmed by frustration, Liska's inner "Little Volcano" erupts, and she screams at her friends, scaring them away and ruining the adventure. Guided by her mother and the "Golden Rule," Liska realizes her angry demands pushed away the very help she needed. She learns that to work together, she must first calm herself with deep breaths and then communicate her worries respectfully, asking for her friends' ideas instead of demanding they follow hers. By learning to treat her friends how she wants to be treated, she not only retrieves the treasure but, more importantly, rebuilds their trust and friendship.
