# What it should be about

# Liska's Saving Adventure

## **Act 1: Introduction**

**Introduce character(s), setting, and atmosphere (3-4 sentences):**
Liska loves going to market with her parents. Every market day, Father gives her one shiny bead to spend. She always buys treats and spends her bead right away.

## **Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins**

**Lead-up:**
Another market day - Liska walks with her parents among the colorful stalls, looking at all the treats and foods.

**The Catalyst (Misstep/Misjudgment):**
Liska spends her bead on a small treat before reaching the kebab stand.

**The Core Incident (External Problem/Challenge):**
When she gets to Kebab Man's stall, she smells her favorite fish kebabs and wants one, but has no money left. She feels sad about missing her favorite food.

## **Act 3: Attempts to Solve – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil**

**Attempt 1 (Initial Reaction):**
Next market day, Liska doesn't spend her bead. She comes to kebab stand with one bead and asks for a kebab, but learns it costs 3 beads. She can't buy it again.
**Outcome:** She asks Father what to do. He explains the concept of saving money.

**Attempt 2 (Developing Approach):**
Liska saves her one bead and gets another on the next market day. She tries very hard (in comedic ways) not to spend the beads. She comes to the stand with 2 beads, but it's still not enough for the 3-bead kebab.
**Outcome:** She gets distraught from trying so hard but still not getting what she wants. She goes and spends both beads on other treats.

**Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback):**
When she comes home, she realizes she has zero beads and won't be able to buy her kebab AGAIN AND AGAIN. She feels disappointed and depressed about the repeating pattern.

**Re-evaluation/Insight:**
Father sees her distress and offers to help. He makes her a magic savings jar with exactly 3 slots to save for her kebab. He explains immediate gratification - why it's pleasant but why we regret it after. He advises her to put her market money in the jar and not take it with her to resist temptation. When the jar lights up fully, that's celebration day!

## **Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally**

**Final Attempt (Applying New Understanding):**
Next market day, Liska puts her bead in the jar. It lights up, making her mood better. She struggles but keeps the bead at home. At the market, she's a bit sad she can't buy anything, but not too much. She's glad she didn't spend the bead.

**Rising Tension/Suspense:**
Next market day, she gets the second bead. It's very hard to resist going to market AGAIN without buying anything. She struggles. Will she be able to resist and buy the kebab?! Or will she take the beads??

**The Turning Point (Demonstrating Growth):**
Father supports her, saying it's the last time and next time will be kebab day! She huffs cutely but manages to put the bead in and leave the jar home. We show how eagerly she waits for the next market day.

**Success (External Problem Resolved):**
Finally the third market day! She gets the bead, puts it in the jar with the whole family watching. The jar lights up completely! So beautiful! Today is finally kebab day! Father recommends taking the whole jar to celebrate her accomplishment.

**Immediate Reward/Relief:**
They come to market. She immediately runs to Kebab Man, waving her jar in the air. He smiles widely. She cries: "One kebab please!" He says: "3 beads" and extends his hand. She proudly pours the beads from her jar into his hand and gets her kebab! Finally!

## **Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth**

**Relaxation/Immediate Aftermath:**
Liska savors her kebab and feels satisfied both from the food and from achieving her goal. It's the tastiest kebab of her life because she worked hard for it!

**Reflection & Learning:**
Liska understands that waiting for something bigger and better is worth more than getting small things right away. She learned that saving needs tools and strategies to help with self-control.

**Making it Right/Integration:**
Liska thanks Father for teaching her about saving and for the magical jar that helped her succeed.

**Concluding Thought/Wrap-up:**
Liska looks forward to her next saving adventure, having learned that bigger rewards are worth the wait. She fantasizes about what else she can save for.
