## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere
<!-- PLOT: A new, oversized plant changes Liska's familiar room. -->

One morning, Mama and Liska squeezed something enormous through the bedroom door. 

"Just... a... little... more!" Mama grunted, pushing the heavy pot.

Liska anchored her little feet, grabbed a giant leaf, and pulled with a mighty little "Hnngh!".
<!-- старательным крошечным «Хнннгх!» -->

With a final push — SKWEEEAK! — in came their new monstera plant, its leaves full of holes, just like Swiss cheese.


<!-- Do not touch pink nose, it's cute. Maybe a funnier simile -->
"It's a friendly cheese plant! - Liska declared - I name it Mr. Cheesy!" Her pink nose poked through a leaf-hole like a tiny curious button.

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
<!-- PLOT: The plant is initially a fun, dynamic playmate. -->

That afternoon, Liska made the shadow her new playmate. "High-five!" she giggled, slapping her palm against a big leaf-shadow on the wall. The wind moved the plant's leaves, and the shadow danced away. Liska went *SQUEEEE*, ready to chase it down for another high-five.

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
<!-- PLOT: At night, the shadow's movement becomes ambiguous and unsettling. -->

As night fell, Mama tucked Liska in tight as a cinnamon roll. A gust of wind made plant's shadow stretch and sway with the branches outside.

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
<!-- PLOT: Liska's perception shifts: the ambiguous shadow becomes a definite threat. -->

The friendly leaves grew longer... and longer... until they didn't look like leaves anymore. Now they looked like claws!

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)
<!-- PLOT: Liska's first coping mechanism is ineffective avoidance (hiding). -->

Liska's eyes widened. *It's just Mr. Cheesy.* She pulled the blanket over her head. "Go away," she whispered. "You're just a plant."

### Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)
<!-- PLOT: Avoidance backfires, amplifying fear and forcing her to seek help. -->

But under the blanket her imagination took over. What if the shadow crept across the floor? What if it touched her blanket? What if— 

Her heart started to beat very fast: BA-DUM, BA-DUM. BA-DUM, BA-DUM.

She threw the blanket off. The shadow's arms stretched long against the wall. It looked as if they were grasping... grasping for HER!

Liska scrambled out of bed, flew down the hall, and crashed into her mother's legs. "MAMA!" she sobbed. "The shadow has CLAWS and it wants to GRAB ME!"

### Beat 3.3: Recovery
<!-- PLOT: A parent's co-regulation provides safety and reframes the threat by introducing shadow play. -->

Mama scooped her up. "Oh, sweet kitten, you're so scared" she murmured, holding Liska close. 

She carried her back to the bedroom and they peeked inside.

"You're right" - Mama said - "That shadow does look like claws."

Liska nodded, leaving a wet patch of tears and maybe a little snot on Mama's nightgown. 

As Mama tucked Liska back into bed, Mama's paws moved into the moonlight. 

A shadow butterfly appeared on the wall. She made it fly closer to the plant's shadow and circle a leafy claw. 

Liska watched, her eyes wide. The shadow butterfly was... beautiful? Not scary? 

"It's like they're dancing," she whispered. 

### Beat 3.4: Solution Discovery
<!-- PLOT: Liska asks for help and learns concrete coping skills (breathing, shadow play). -->

The next evening, Liska asked, "Ma-am, I'm still scared of the shadow. Can you help me?"

"Of course, kitten," her mother answered. "How does your body feel?"

"My heart is going thump-thump, thump-thump"

<!-- can we make it more fun? -->
"I see," said her mother. "Then we need to help it calm down. Breath in like you smell a big flower... Liska took a slow *sniff* in... and breathe out like you cool down the hot soup... and a long *whoooosh* out."

"Mama," Liska said, "remember the butterfly you made? I wanna do it too."

Mama helped her fold her paws, and a wobbly butterfly appeared on the wall.

Mama pointed to the watering-can shadow wiggling in the lamplight. "Looks like a grumpy elephant," she whispered. "I bet his trunk is ticklish!"

Liska made her butterfly circle the trunk once... twice... and... zipped in to bop it on the snoot!

<!-- и из Лиски вырвался маленький *фырк* -->
The trunk-shadow wobbled, and a tiny *snort* escaped Liska. The trunk looked like it wanted to dance.

A new thought sparked inside her: *Ooh! I can make them dance!*

---

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt
<!-- PLOT: Liska independently uses a learned skill to manage fear. -->

The night came, and Mr. Cheesy’s shadow again crept across the wall. Liska’s heart began to thump. But this time was different. Clutching her sloth until she worried his stuffing might pop, she smelled the flower, *SNIIIFF*, and cooled the soup, *WHOOOOSH*. 

Slowly, like a brave little snail, she stood up. She lifted one shaky paw and it's shadow appeared on the wall. Small and wobbly, but THERE. 

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback
<!-- PLOT: Facing the fear is hard; it requires persistence and self-encouragement. -->

It was almost touching the shadow claws. Liska's heart thumped again and her paw froze. 

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested → Learned Skill → Persistence
<!-- PLOT: She persists through fear, applying her skill to confront the source. -->

"Come on, shadow paw," she whispered. "You're mine. Be brave."

She stubbornly pushed her paw forward. Her shadow touched the plant shadow, and...

### Beat 4.4: Success
<!-- PLOT: The confrontation leads to a realization: the threat was never real. -->

Nothing happened. No grabbing, no eating. Just her shadow-paw on the shadow-leaf.

### Beat 4.5: Reward → Relief
<!-- PLOT: Needs deep vivid satisfaction -->

"You're not scary," she said. "You're just... another shadow! You can't DO anything!" 

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning

Then Liska noticed Slothy hiding under her arm. "Oh, you're scared too?" she whispered, hugging him. "It's okay. We just do the flower-soup breath. In... and out. Better, right?"

"And now LET'S FIGHT THE SHADOW CHEESE MONSTER!"

She made Slothy's shadow climb up the shadows's leafy claws. Higher and higher, until it reached the very top leaf.

<!-- Liska made Slothy do a tiny shadow dance, in just a few words. Then it yawned. -->
There, it found a comfortable spot and gave a big, slow shadow-yawn.

The monster was gone. It became a bed in which a brave little hero slept peacefully. They won.

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo

Mama, watching from the doorway, smiled. "I see we have brave new shadow dancers in here."

Liska watched the scene she had created with a small, proud smile on her face. 


### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
<!-- PLOT: The goal isn't eliminating fear, but gaining confidence to manage it. -->
Next night, when the shadows grew long again, Liska snuggled with Slothy. She was ready. "Come on, Mr. Cheesy," she whispered. "Let's dance."
