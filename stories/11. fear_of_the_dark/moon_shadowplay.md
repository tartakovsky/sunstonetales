Based on the research on moonlight physics and shadow formation, here's how to draw the moonbeam shadow play:

**Light source and beam:**
- Draw the moon visible through the window, positioned at an angle (not directly overhead)
- The moonbeam enters through the window creating a rectangular or trapezoidal patch of silver-blue light on the floor
- The beam shape follows the window frame but stretches/distorts based on the moon's angle

**Shadow direction and characteristics:**
- Shadows cast AWAY from the window, opposite the moon's position
- If the moon is high and to the left of the window, shadows stretch low and to the right
- Moonlight shadows are soft-edged, not sharp - use gradual transitions from light to dark
- The shadows are longer than they would be in daylight due to the moon's typical lower angle

**Visual rendering:**
- The moonlit area: Pale silver-blue, not pure white
- The shadows: Soft gray-blue, not black - you can still see floor texture through them
- The transition zones: Gradual fade between light and shadow, no hard edges
- The surrounding room: Deep blue-gray darkness with subtle detail visible

**The child and doll shadows:**
- When the child holds the doll up in the moonbeam, its shadow falls on the floor beyond the lit rectangle
- As she moves the doll closer to the floor, the shadow grows larger and softer
- Moving the doll higher makes the shadow smaller but still diffuse
- The plant's shadow should already be visible at the edge of the moonbeam, creating the "monster" shape

**Key visual difference from sunlight:** The shadows overlap and blend rather than creating distinct separate shadows. This creates the dreamy, less threatening quality perfect for transforming fear into play.

The child sits cross-legged on the wooden floor where the moonbeam cuts a silver rectangle through the darkness. She holds her cloth doll upright in the light stream, watching its shadow stretch long across the floorboards. When she tilts the doll left, the shadow slides right. She lifts it higher and the shadow shrinks; lowers it and the shadow grows tall and thin. She discovers that rotating the doll makes its shadow-arms seem to wave. The plant's shadow looms at the edge of the moonbeam, but now she sees how her doll's shadow can touch it, dance alongside it. She moves the doll in small circles, making its shadow swirl around the plant-shadow's edges. The two shadows merge and separate as she experiments with distance and angle. When a cloud dims the moon momentarily, both shadows fade to gray whispers before returning sharp when the light strengthens. She begins moving the doll in rhythm with her breathing, slow and steady, the shadow following each motion. The plant shadow no longer stands alone and threatening - it has become part of her shadow theater, another shape in the moonlight to play with rather than fear.
