## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere

Earlier that day, Liska had been a mighty jungle explorer. She'd helped Mara carry the biggest plant in the whole world through her doorway - well, Mara carried it while Liska held one leaf and directed: "Left! No, MY left!"

The monstera was magnificent. Its leaves had holes like swiss cheese, and Liska immediately declared it was a friendly monster who liked to nibble on itself for breakfast.

All day, the plant had played with her. Morning sun made gentle leaf-hands wave hello on the wall. Lunchtime brought sharp shadow-puppets that danced while she ate. During dinner, the candle flames made the shadows bow and curtsy like fancy dancers at a ball.

Now the moon had taken over shadow-duty. Liska lay in bed, wound up tight as a cinnamon roll, her faithful sloth squished against her chest. Soft moonlight painted silver stripes across her blanket. Her room smelled like sleepy flowers and the faint green scent of her new plant-friend. A tiny, contented purr rumbled in her throat - the sound of one perfectly happy snow leopard kit in her cozy shadow kingdom.
<!-- why she was happy and not afraid when it's already dark and 
no mom? -->

<!-- no, she's not in bed yet here. Mother tucks her in in the next beat. Before that she raises Liska to the window and they wave to the moon together, that's their goodnight ritual. She scratches Liska's ear in a very special way. -->

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up

Mara's silhouette filled the doorway. She padded across the moon-striped floor to plant one last kiss on Liska's forehead. The room glowed silver-blue, and in that strange night-light, everything looked different. The cheerful plant shadows had stretched long and mysterious, swaying with the wind like something alive.
<!-- we need to incorporate moon waving ritual and special ear scratch 
before sleep into each goodnight story -->

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

Mara kissed Liska's forehead one last time. "Sweet dreams, little love." The door whispered shut with a soft click.
<!-- no doors, their rooms are separated with curtains and look like rounded alcoves-->
### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident

Liska's eyes popped open. 
 <!-- why would they pop open? Shadows don't wake us up. She doesn't see shadow, there is no shadow from her perspective -->

The shadow on the wall had... changed. What had been friendly leaf-hands now looked like reaching fingers. Long, grabby fingers with too many joints. The holes in the leaves became watching eyes. The stems turned into creeping legs.

She blinked hard. It was just her plant. Her friendly nibbling monster plant. She'd named it Mr. Cheese this afternoon.

But in the shifting moonlight, Mr. Cheese looked HUNGRY.

Her heart started its little drum solo - BA-DUM, BA-DUM, BA-DUM, BA-DUM. The Little Mouse feeling skittered up her spine. She was so small, and that shadow was getting bigger every time the wind blew.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)

<!-- no rockets, it's medieval setting -->
Liska launched from her bed like a fuzzy rocket. Sloth clutched to her chest, tiny feet barely touching the ground, she flew down the hall and crashed straight into Mara's legs.

"Mama! Mama! The plant grew ARMS and it wants to EAT ME!"

Mara scooped up her trembling kit, feeling the rapid thump-thump-thump of Liska's heart against her chest. "Oh my goodness, that sounds very scary. Should we go check on Mr. Cheese together?"

They tiptoed back, Liska clinging like a baby koala. The room looked peaceful. Moonlight. Plant. Regular plant-in-a-pot plant.

Mara lit a candle, golden light dancing with silver. "Hmm, let me see these hungry arms..." She held the candle near the wall, and suddenly her hand made a shadow. "Oh! Look - I can make shadows too!"

Her fingers became a butterfly, fluttering across the wall right over the plant shadow. "Hello, Mr. Cheese! The butterfly wants to be friends!"

Despite everything, Liska peeked. The butterfly shadow danced with the leaf shadows, making them look... silly? Not scary?

"See? It's shadow games," Mara whispered, rubbing Liska's back in slow circles. "Mr. Cheese can't leave his pot. He's stuck there like... like feet in shoes!"

<!-- don't delete my fucking comments. I asked whether it's a good idea to keep it same day, or maybe mom should actually put her to bed and she dysregulates next night. -->
Liska giggled a tiny bit at that. Mara tucked her back in, stayed until her breathing evened out, then tiptoed away.

But shadows don't care about logic. The moment Liska was alone, the wind gusted. The shadow arms reached further, grasping at nothing, grasping at everything, grasping at HER.

### Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)

The shadow arms were longer now. And there were MORE of them. How did Mr. Cheese grow extra arms? That wasn't fair!

Liska pulled her blanket over her head. "Go 'way," she whispered. "You're just a plant. Just a silly plant with cheese holes."

But under the blanket was worse. Now she couldn't see what the shadow was doing. What if it crept across the floor? What if it touched her blanket? What if—

She threw off the blanket. The shadow loomed enormous. The Little Mouse in her chest panicked, scrambling to escape.

This time when she ran, she was already sobbing. Big, gulping sobs that shook her whole body. She crashed into Mara again, words tumbling out wet and jumbled: "Why-won't-it-stop-being-scary-when-I-KNOW-it's-just-a-plant?"

### Beat 3.3: Recovery
<!-- no couches, they mostly live on the floor on big mats and cushions -->
Mara didn't even try to walk back to the scary room this time. She carried her soggy, hiccupping kit straight to the big couch, settling into the soft cushions with Liska curled in her lap.

"Oh sweetpea," she murmured, rocking slowly. "Sometimes our scared feelings are bigger than our knowing-thoughts, aren't they?"

Liska nodded into Mara's nightgown, leaving a small wet patch of tears and probably some nose-drips too. Mara didn't mind.

They rocked and rocked until the earthquake sobs became tiny aftershock hiccups. Until Liska could breathe without catching. Until the world felt less ending-ish.

"The butterfly visit didn't quite work for when you're alone, did it?" Mara said softly. "Want to find something that helps your brave stay with you?"

### Beat 3.4: Solution Discovery
<!-- zero child agency, Liska just cries and receives, booring -->
The living room was different. Moonbeams made friendly shadows here - the couch was just a soft gray rectangle, the lamp made a gentle tall shape.

"Look," Mara whispered, shifting them both into a moonbeam. "Want to see something special?"

<!-- nothing special, they already did that -->
She lifted her hand and made a butterfly shadow on the wall. It fluttered over to land on the couch shadow.

<!-- didactic and a lie, she doesn't do that -->
"Sometimes when I get scared," Mara said, making the butterfly dance, "I notice my body getting all tight and thumpy. Feel your chest - what's it doing?"

Liska put a paw on her chest. "Boom-boom-boom. Like... like little fast drums!"

<!-- even more boring -->
"That's your body keeping you safe, being extra alert. And what helps drums slow down?" Mara pulled Liska closer. "A good squeeze and some slow breaths. Want to try?"

They breathed together - in through the nose, out through the mouth. Liska's sloth got an extra-special squeeze.

"Better?" 

"Little bit." The drums were still there but... quieter?

"Now watch." Mara's butterfly shadow danced again. "When the drums get quieter, we can play. Want to make your own shadow?"

Liska lifted one shaky paw. A small shadow appeared on the wall. She wiggled her fingers - the shadow wiggled back! She touched her shadow to the friendly couch shadow. They just... touched. No grabbing. No eating. Just shadows being shadows.

"I made friends with the couch!" Liska giggled.

Soon they were telling shadow stories. Liska's hands became a bunny. Mara's became a tree. The lamp shadow turned into a tall friend. And something magic happened - each time Liska felt the drums starting, she'd hug her sloth tight-tight-tight, do a dragon breath, and her body would remember it was okay to play.

"We're the shadow dancers!" Liska announced, making her bunny shadow hop across the wall.

"The very best shadow dancers," Mara agreed. "And shadow dancers know the secret - shadows are just places where light can't go. They can't hurt us. They can only dance."

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

The next night came whether Liska wanted it or not. After their moon-waving and ear-scratching, after Mara's goodnight kiss, Liska found herself alone with Mr. Cheese again.

The shadow started its creeping dance across the wall.

Thump-thump-thump went the drums. But this time, Liska clutched her sloth before the Little Mouse could take over completely.

"Hi drums," she whispered, feeling silly talking to her own chest. "I hear you being loud."

She tried a dragon breath. It came out more like a shaky lizard breath, but it was something. Her sloth's fur tickled her nose.

Slowly, like a brave snail, she pushed back her blanket and stood up.

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback

But standing made everything worse. The shadow looked ENORMOUS from here. And her feet - why were her feet being so stupid? They wouldn't move. They were stuck to the floor like someone had glued them down with the stickiest glue in the whole world.

"Come on, feet," she whispered. "We're shadow dancers, remember?"

But her feet didn't remember anything. They just wanted to run back to bed and hide forever.

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested → Learned Skill → Persistence

The drums went BOOM BOOM BOOM. Liska squeezed her sloth so hard she worried his stuffing might pop out.

"Dragon breath," she reminded herself. "Sleepy dragon." 

In through the nose - it smelled like sloth fur and nighttime. Out through the mouth - whoooooosh.

The tiniest bit of brave crept back into her toes.

She lifted one shaky paw into the moonbeam. Her shadow appeared on the wall - small and wobbly, but THERE.

"Hi, shadow hand," she whispered. "You're mine. You have to be brave 'cause I said so."

Her shadow hand crept across the wall. Closer to Mr. Cheese's reaching arms. Closer...

Her heart drums went crazy. What if the shadow grabbed her shadow hand? What if shadows could eat other shadows? What if—

"Dragon breath!" she said out loud, surprising herself. Another whoooosh.

Closer... almost there...

### Beat 4.4: Success

Her shadow touched the plant shadow.

And.

Nothing happened.

They just... overlapped. Like when you put one hand on top of the other. No grabbing. No eating. No scary anything. Just her little shadow hand resting on the big shadow leaf.

"Oh!" Liska breathed. Then louder: "OH!"

She wiggled her fingers. The shadows danced together. She made her shadow hand pat the shadow leaf like petting a cat.

"You're not scary," she told Mr. Cheese's shadow. "You're just... you're just a shadow! You can't DO anything!"

### Beat 4.5: Reward → Relief

The Little Mouse feeling melted like ice cream in sunshine. Something warm and sparkly and HUGE filled up Liska's chest instead. She'd done it! She'd been scared-scared-scared but she'd stayed!

"Shadow dance party!" she announced to her room.

She made both hands into shadows now. They became birds, then bunnies, then just happy finger-wiggles. Her sloth made a shadow too when she held him up. Even her ears made pointy shadows when she turned her head.

"Look at us, Mr. Cheese!" she giggled. "We're all shadows! But I'm the only real one who can move around!"

She did a little victory dance, and her shadow danced on the wall. The plant shadow swayed when the wind blew, like it was trying to dance too.

"Okay, you can dance," she told it generously. "But no grabbing!"

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning

Back in bed, Liska held her sloth up to share the big news. "We did it, Slothy! The drums came but we breathed like dragons and then we danced!"

She thought about it more. "First the drums, then squeeze-you-tight, then dragon breath, then we could play. That's how it works!"

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo

Morning came with honey-colored light. Mr. Cheese's shadow was completely different - soft and small and not even a little bit grabby.

But Liska's chest still did a tiny drum-flutter when she first saw it.

Without really thinking, she grabbed Slothy. One dragon breath. Then she lifted her hand to make a morning shadow.

"Morning, Mr. Cheese," she said, making her shadow wave. The plant shadow waved back in the breeze.

At breakfast, she told Mara all about it. "The shadow was only a little bit scary this morning. Just baby drums. So I hugged Slothy and did one dragon breath and then we had a tiny dance party."

"You found your own brave way," Mara said, her smile warm as sunshine.

"The shadow dancer way!" Liska agreed, doing a little wiggle in her chair.

### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought

That night, as moonlight crept across her wall, Liska watched Mr. Cheese's shadow appear. The drums started their thumping - they probably always would. But that was okay.

She had everything she needed.

"Come on, drums," she whispered, hugging her sloth. "Let's dance."
