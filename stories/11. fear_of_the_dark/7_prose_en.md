## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere

One morning, Mama and Liska squeezed something HUGE through the bedroom door. 

"Just... a... little... more!" Mama grunted, pushing the heavy pot.

Liska planted her little feet, grabbed a giant leaf, and tugged with a mighty little "Hnngh!".
<!-- старательным крошечным «Хнннгх!» -->

With a final push — SKREEECH! — in came their new monstera plant, its leaves full of holes, just like Swiss cheese.

Her tiny pink nose poked through a leaf-hole.

"A cheese plant!" Liska said. "I name you Mr. Cheesy!"

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up

That afternoon, Liska played with the plant's shadow. 

"High-five!" she giggled, slapping her palm against a leaf-shadow on the wall. 

The wind from the open window moved the plant's leaves, and the shadow moved away. A happy *SQUEEEE!* burst from Liska as she chased it down for another high-five.

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

As night fell, Mama tucked Liska in tight as a cinnamon roll, her stuffed sloth, Slothy, snuggled under her arm. A *WHOOSH* of wind made Mr. Cheesy's shadow stretch and swing.

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident

Suddenly, the leaf-shadows grew longer... and sharper... until they didn't look like leaves anymore. Now they looked like claws!

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)

Liska's eyes widened. *It's just Mr. Cheesy.* She hugged Slothy and pulled the blanket over her head. "Go away," she whispered. "You're just a plant."

### Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)

But under the blanket, her head filled with scary thoughts. What if the shadow crept closer? What if it touched her? What if— 

A quick, loud thumping started in her chest: BA-DUM, BA-DUM. BA-DUM, BA-DUM.

She threw the blanket off, tumbled out of bed and scampered out of the room. 

"MAMA!" she cried. "The shadow has CLAWS and it wants to GRAB ME!"

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

Mama scooped her up.

"Oh, sweet kitten, you're so scared," she said softly.

She carried her back to the bedroom and they peeked inside.

"You're right," Mama said. "That shadow does look a little spiky."

Liska nodded, leaving tears and maybe a little snot on Mama's nightgown. 

As Mama tucked Liska back into bed, she held up her paws in the moonlight, folding them until their shadow became a butterfly on the wall.

She made it fly closer to the plant's shadow. Then around its leafy claw. 

Liska watched, her eyes wide. The shadow butterfly was... beautiful? Not scary? 

"It's like they're dancing," she whispered. 

### Beat 3.4: Solution Discovery

The next evening, Liska asked, "Maamaa, I'm scared of that shadow. Help me?"

"Of course, kitten," her mother answered. "How does your body feel?"

"My heart is going thump-thump, thump-thump."

"Then let's help it calm down," her mother said. "Breathe in like you smell a flower, and breathe out like you cool down hot soup. A slow *SNIFF* in... and a long *WHOOOSH* out."

"Mama," Liska said, "remember the butterfly you made? I wanna do it too."

Mama helped her link her thumbs together, and a wobbly butterfly appeared on the wall.

Mama looked around.

"Look," she whispered, pointing. "The shadow from your little watering can looks like an elephant. I bet his trunk is ticklish!"

Liska made her butterfly circle the trunk once... twice... and... zipped in to bop it on the snoot!

<!-- и из Лиски вырвался маленький *фырк* -->
The trunk-shadow wobbled, and a tiny *SNORT* came out of Liska. The trunk looked like it wanted to dance.

A new thought sparked inside her: *Ooh! I can make them DANCE!*

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

Later that night, Mr. Cheesy’s shadow again stretched across the wall. Liska’s heart began to thump, but this time she knew what to do. She squeezed Slothy so hard, she imagined his fluff might come out. She smelled the flower, *SNIIIFF*, and cooled the soup, *WHOOOOSH*. 

Then, slowly, like a brave little snail, she stood up. She lifted one shaky paw and its shadow appeared on the wall. Small and wobbly, but THERE. 

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback

It was almost touching the shadow claws. Liska's heart thumped faster and her paw froze. 

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested → Learned Skill → Persistence

"Come on, shadow paw," she whispered. "You're mine. Be brave."

She pushed her paw forward until her shadow-paw softly touched the plant shadow, and...

### Beat 4.4: Success

Nothing happened. No grabbing. Just her shadow-paw on the shadow-leaf. Her own paw was safe.

### Beat 4.5: Reward → Relief

"You're not scary," she said. "You're just... another shadow! You can't DO anything!" 

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning

Then Liska looked down at Slothy, tucked under her arm. "Oh, you're scared too?" she whispered, hugging him. "It's okay. We just do the flower-soup breath. In... and out."

"And now LET'S PLAY WITH THE SHADOW CHEESE MONSTER!"

She held Slothy up and brought his shadow right up to the leafy claw. She moved it closer... closer... and suddenly gave the shadow claw a little high-five! *pat*!

There was no monster. Just her friend, Mr. Cheesy, wiggling in the wind.

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo

Mama, watching from the doorway, smiled.

"Look at you, my brave little shadow dancer!"

<!-- Лиска ткнулась носиком в мамину ладонь и тихо мурлыкнула: "...".
 -->
Liska snuggled into her mother’s paw and purred softly: "I did it."


### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought

She looked at the shadows, now just familiar shapes on the wall. "Good night, Mr. Cheesy," she whispered. "Tomorrow, we'll dance again."
