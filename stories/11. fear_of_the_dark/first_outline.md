### How Liska Was Afraid of the Dark

### **Act 1: Introduction**

*   **1.1: Setting and Atmosphere:**
    *   Liska’s cozy, warm room at night. Moonlight streams through the window, making soft shapes on the wooden floor. The atmosphere is peaceful and sleepy.
*   **1.2: Character Introduction:**
    *   Liska, a little snow leopard, is curled up in her bed. Her sloth, a soft, floppy toy, is tucked under her arm. She is content and ready for sleep.

### **Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins**

*   **2.2: The Catalyst:**
    *   Her mother, Mara, comes in to give her a final goodnight kiss, hanging her heavy traveling coat on a wall peg before leaving the room.
*   **2.3: The Core Incident:**

    <!-- Coat specifically is kinda lame. Also it's bedroom, pepople don't hang coats there. -->
    *   In the shifting moonlight, the coat's shadow looms large and unfamiliar. It looks to Liska like a hunched monster with a long, reaching arm.
    *   **Slot:** `Emotional Trigger: Scary/Threatening`
*   **2.4: Fallout:**
    *   Liska’s heart thumps. She feels like a **`Little Mouse`**, tiny and scared. She scrambles from her bed and runs to her mother.
    *   **Slot:** `Emotion Group: Fear / Anxiety`
    *   **Slot:** `Dysregulation: With Parent - High Distress`

### **Act 3: Attempts to Solve / Unravel – Facing the Problem**

*   **3.1: Recovery:**
    *   Mara meets her with a hug. She doesn't dismiss the fear.
    *   **Slot:** `Regulation Strategy: Parent-Child Co-Regulation`
    *   **Slot:** `Support: Calm Presence`, `Physical Contact`, `Feeling Validation` ("I see you're scared. That's a big feeling.")
*   **3.2: Attempt 1 (Guided Investigation):**
    
    <!-- Should be Liska's choice which toy to take. "Wanna take someone with us?" -->
    *   Mara says, "Let's be brave explorers together. An explorer needs a brave companion. Should we take your sloth?" Liska nods, grabbing the sloth. The three of them—Mara, Liska, and the sloth—go back to the room. Mara lights a candle, revealing the coat. Liska is still wary, but the immediate fear subsides into caution.
*   **3.3: Attempt 2 (Familiarization through Play):**
    *   The next evening, Mara initiates a game. "Remember our shadow adventure? Let's play with it." With the sloth sitting beside them, they use the candle to make the coat's shadow dance. They give it a silly name. It's fun. The shadow is now associated with safety and play.
    *   **Slot:** `Solution Discovery Process: Creative Re-framing`
    *   **Slot:** `Practice: Safe Trial Run`
*   **3.4: Low Point (Confronting Fear Alone):**
    *   The following night, Mara tucks her in and leaves. Liska is alone with the sloth. The familiar, silent shadow of the coat looms in the corner. Though she *knows* it's the coat, the fear creeps back in. She feels overwhelmed and alone.
    *   **Slot:** `Dysregulation: Alone - Moderate Distress`
*   **3.5: Recovery (Self-Regulation):**
    *   She pulls the covers up, her heart beating fast. She remembers her mother's words.
    *   **Slot:** `Coping Strategy: Simple Self-Talk` (She whispers, "I'm home. It's my room. I'm safe.")
    *   **Slot:** `Coping Strategy: My Special Comfort Item` (She hugs her sloth tightly.)
*   **3.6: Re-evaluation (The Click):**
    *   Hugging the sloth triggers the memory of being a brave explorer with her mother. She remembers the shadow-dancing game. The feeling shifts from fear to a flicker of curiosity. She decides she needs to see for herself, one last time.
    *   **Slot:** `Solution Discovery Process: Memory Scaffolding`

### **Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Internally**

*   **4.1: Final Attempt:**
    *   Clutching her sloth, Liska swings her legs out of bed.
*   **4.2: Rising Tension:**
    *   She stands, hesitating. Her paws feel frozen to the floor. The shadow seems to grow bigger in the quiet room.
*   **4.3: The Turning Point (The "Spot, Stop, Shift"):**
    *   She **spots** the feeling ("My heart is beating like a little mouse"). She **stops** and takes a shaky breath. She **shifts** her focus by hugging her sloth companion, anchoring herself in the memory of being a brave explorer. This gives her the final push.
*   **4.4: Success:**
    *   She scurries across the room and touches the rough fabric of the coat. It's just a coat.
*   **4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief:**
    <!-- the fear wouldn't be gone? But other feelings would be stronger. Relief. Exhileration from success? Pride? -->
    *   A wave of calm washes over her. The `Little Mouse` fear is gone. She breathes out, feeling proud and safe. The reward is internal: a deep sense of peace and accomplishment.

### **Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth**

*   **5.1: Relaxation / Immediate Aftermath:**
    *   She gives the coat a little pat, then scurries back to bed, hugging her sloth. She feels tired, but safe.
*   **5.2: Reflection & Learning:**
    *   The next morning, she tells Mara, "I was a brave explorer last night. The sloth and I went on an adventure."
    *   **Slot:** `Support: Process Praise` (Mara smiles. "You found your own brave inside you. That's the best kind of explorer.")
*   **5.4: New Status Quo:**
    *   A few nights later, we see Liska in bed. Before falling asleep, she takes her sloth and makes its shadow dance on the wall for a moment. They are no longer scary; they are her friends.
*   **5.5: Concluding Thought:**
    *   Liska learned that some shadows look scary, but a brave explorer with a good friend can always find the light.`
