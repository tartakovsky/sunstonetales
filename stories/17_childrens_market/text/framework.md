### **Framework 1: Psychological Analysis (The "Why")**

**Core Emotion:** Rejection and Disappointment. This is triggered when the external world fails to share Liska's enthusiasm for her creation. For a 4-6 year old, the line between the self and a treasured object is blurry; rejecting the fox feels like a direct rejection of Liska herself.

**Primary Drivers:**
1.  **Egocentric Thinking:** Liska assumes everyone sees the world as she does. The core of her disappointment isn't that she failed at a transaction, but that others don't immediately recognize the obvious (to her) value and specialness of her fox. This is a classic feature of preoperational thought.
2.  **Attachment & Externalized Value:** The fox is not just an object; it's a container for her effort, pride, and imagination. Its value is not abstract but deeply personal. She expects this value to be self-evident, and its rejection causes a fundamental feeling of "wrongness."
3.  **Developing Theory of Mind (Context-Specific):** The story prompts a rudimentary lesson in perspective-taking, not just that others have different desires, but that objects have appropriate *contexts*. The problem is reframed from "they don't like my fox" to "this is not the right place for my fox."

**Secondary Drivers:**
1.  **Goal Obstruction:** Her simple, concrete goal ("trade my fox for something neat") is blocked, leading to a basic, overwhelming frustration.
2.  **Emotional Contagion:** In a busy market, the perceived happiness and success of others can amplify her own feelings of disappointment and isolation, even if she isn't consciously comparing competence.

### **Framework 2: The Child's Subjective Experience (The "What")**

**CRITICAL: Written from Liska's perspective (age 4-6).**

**Immediate Response (First Seconds):**
- "Look! My fox!" (thought)
- "They didn't look."
- "My mouth is sad now."
- "Put him here."
- "Hold my fox. Squeeze."

**Primary Feelings (What Overwhelms Them):**
- "Nobody wants him."
- "My fox is a bad fox."
- "Want to hide."
- "My tummy feels all scrunchy."
- "My eyes are hot."

**Physical Sensations (How Their Body Feels):**
- "My face feels hot."
- "Want to curl up small."
- "Don't want to stand up anymore."
- "Everything feels shaky."
- "My body feels all heavy."

**Secondary Reactions (After Initial Response):**
- "Why they don't like him?"
- "I want to go home."
- "That girl was mean."
- "No more market."
- "My fox is sad now, too."

**What They Notice (Environmental Awareness):**
- "Everything is so shiny and loud."
- "All the other toys are better."
- "Everyone else is laughing."
- "The floor is interesting to look at." (staring down)
- "That boy is all alone. Like me."

**Summary:** The progression moves from simple, hopeful presentation to confusion, which quickly collapses into a global feeling of rejection and a desire to physically withdraw from the overwhelming environment.

### **Framework 3: Narrative Implementation (The "How")**

**Environmental Description Setup:**
- *"The other toys were shiny. Her fox was just... woody."*
- *"All the laughing sounded too loud in her ears."*
- *"The bright colors made her want to close her eyes."*
- *"Her table felt very small, and she felt very small on it."*
- *"The fox looked like he was hiding, even out in the open."*

**Character's Physical Experience:**
- *"Her cheeks got hot when the girl walked away."*
- *"Her arm felt heavy, and she let the fox drop to her side."*
- *"She slid down to sit under the table, where it was quiet and dark."*
- *"She hugged her knees and put her chin on them."*
- *"When she saw the little forest, her head lifted up all by itself."*

**Character's Thoughts/Words (Age-Appropriate):**
- *"But... he's a good fox. He's an explorer."*
- *"Why does everything have to be sparkly?"*
- *"This 'need-detective' thing is too hard."*
- *"Maybe nobody needs a fox."*
- *"Wait. His world is empty. Maybe... he can live there?"*
- *"Maybe he needs... a home?"* (Liska processing Tahrra's advice)
- *"Aha! A forest! That's a home for a fox!"*
- *"Maybe... he can live there?"*

**Showing Internal State Through Action:**
- *She presents the fox held out in both hands, an offering.*
- *After being ignored, she pulls the fox back and holds it against her chest.*
- *She puts the fox away under the table, tucking him out of sight.*
- *She peeks over the table, her eyes just visible, to watch the other children.*
- *She walks directly over to the boy with the bark-world, her purpose clear and simple.*

**Sensory Vocabulary (Prioritized for this emotion):**
- Primary words: quiet, small, heavy, sad, bad, empty, dark.
- Supporting words: hot (cheeks), loud, scrunchy (tummy), wobbly, stuck, yucky, tight, slumped, ignored, lost.

**Key Narrative Techniques:**
1.  **Symbolic Proxy:** Use the physical handling and position of the fox as a direct proxy for Liska's self-esteem. When it's hidden, she feels shame. When it's proudly displayed, she is confident.
2.  **Internal Monologue vs. External Reality:** Contrast Liska's rich internal narrative about the fox (he's a "brave explorer") with the blunt, dismissive feedback from the external world ("He isn't very sparkly").
3.  **Perspective-Filtering:** The description of the market should be filtered through Liska's emotional state. When she's dejected, the market is a loud, overwhelming assault of color. When she finds purpose, the narrative focus should narrow intensely, blocking out the noise and focusing only on the miniature world.
4.  **Concrete Metaphor as Catalyst:** The turning point is not abstract advice but a concrete, actionable metaphor: "Find a home for him." This reframes the task from selling to searching, which preserves the child's agency.
5.  **Problem of "Place," Not "Value":** The narrative demonstrates that the fox's worth doesn't change, but its context does. The problem is solved by finding the right *place* where the fox's value becomes self-evident, a concept a young child can grasp visually.
6.  **Action-Led Emotion:** A younger child's feelings often follow their actions. She feels better not after *thinking* a new strategy, but after *physically searching* for a "home." The purposeful movement breaks the stasis of her dejection.
7.  **Revised Progression Pattern:** Hopeful Presentation → Confused Rejection → Overwhelmed Withdrawal → **Catalytic Metaphor (Find a Home)** → **Agentic Search (with false start)** → Joyful Discovery of Fit → Shared Play.
