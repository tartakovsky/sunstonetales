<!-- Comment on the whole "rumble" theme

opportunity to build the child's emotional vocabulary? A 4-year-old can understand "angry," "sad," or "frustrated." Does labeling the emotion as "rumbly" obscure the reality of the situation and hinder the child's ability to identify and name these feelings in themselves and others later on?


Accountability: The phrasing "we have big, rumbly feelings" presents the emotion as an external force that happens to the parents, similar to weather. Does this subtly absolve the parents of responsibility for their behavior? Compare it to, "Mama and I are feeling very angry, and we are not handling it well." The latter takes more ownership.

we probably want to drop it.

## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere

The family house was bathed in early morning golden light streaming through the windows. The air was warm and cozy. In the back garden, there was a special sunny corner where the family often curled up together, creating a sense of safety and happiness.

<!-- What's important in the beat:
Special sunny corner in the back garden. Safety and happiness atmosphere.
 -->

**Review:**
> A solid, warm opening. It could be made slightly more evocative by adding more sensory details beyond just sight and temperature.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **LENGTH VIOLATION**: Beat 1.1 must be 1-2 lines maximum. This is 3 sentences.
> - **MISSING STORYTELLING INTRO**: Must start with "That day Liska", "One morning in Sunstone", etc. "One day / Однажды" would be good here.
> - **TOO ABSTRACT**: "sense of safety and happiness" is telling, not concrete sensory detail
> - **NO IMMEDIATE HOOK**: Lacks the required "aww/ooh/laugh" response trigger
> - **PASSIVE DESCRIPTION**: No movement or action to create engagement

### Beat 1.2: Introduce character(s)
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid. She's in the sunny corner from beat 1. The treasures should be specifically these and extremely emotionally resonant.
 -->

Liska sat in the sunny corner, focused intently on finishing a small, thick belt. It was made of three braided strands. Woven into it were her greatest treasures: a small, rainbow 'courage stone' her father had given her. A tuft of her own white baby-fur that her mother had saved and tied with a silver thread. And a tiny, hardened clay tablet bearing her own first paw-print. Her very first mark on the world. "There," she whispered. "Now you're all safe together."

**Suggestions:**
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Whispering to the belt) "There. Now you are all safe together."

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **TELLING NOT SHOWING**: "focused intently" - show through action instead
> - **MISSING PERSONALITY**: What makes Liska uniquely Liska here?

**REWRITE NEEDED**: Focus on one endearing action that shows personality: "Liska's tiny tongue poked out as she tied the last knot. She held up her treasure-braid and [gave it a satisfied nod.]"

---

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid done. Family treasures all together. Tying like a belt is not necessary. She's proud and happy. Really wants to show her parents.
 -->


Her treasure-braid was finally done, tied snug around her waist. It felt like a warm hug. She bounced on her paws, a happy little wiggle starting in her tail. She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parents tense, tense pre-conflict atmosphere
 -->

Liska bounded into the main room and stopped. Papa stood by the window, tail stiff. Mama sat far away, face turned to the wall. Tension between them. This was unusual and unsettling for her.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **ADULT PERSPECTIVE**: "serious faces" is adult interpretation
> - **TELLING**: "This was unusual and unsettling" - show don't tell
> - **NOT A CATALYST**: This is observation, not the triggering action/event
> - **ABSTRACT**: "air felt still and sharp" - needs concrete sensory detail

**NEEDS CLARITY**: What is the actual catalyst here? Is it Liska entering? The parents' state? Be specific about the triggering moment.

> The catalyst is Liska entering and feeling the tension in the room

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parental conflict shown. It hurts Liska. 
 -->

Liska hesitated, then heard her father's voice, a low rumble, "I just don't understand why." Her mother's voice was a sharp whisper from across the room, "I can't talk about this now." The conflict was now undeniable.

**Review:**
> The dialogue confirmed the conflict, but it was very adult-centric. We can rephrase it to be more about the *sound* and *feeling* of the words from Liska's perspective, rather than the content.

**Suggestions:**
> - Liska might not understand the words, but she should understand the *feeling* of them perfectly.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **TELLING**: "The conflict is now undeniable" - show don't tell
> - **ADULT-CENTRIC**: Dialogue content too complex for child perspective
> - **NO PHYSICAL IMPACT**: Where's the immediate physical/emotional effect on Liska?
> - **MISSING STAKES**: How does this problem affect Liska specifically?

### Beat 2.4: Fallout
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Liska's initial dysregulation, not heavy yet, more confusion, a bit of saddness and fear. Emotions shown. Not sure we need rainy cloud specifically, just a simile might be okay  -->

Liska experienced initial dysregulation. Confusion and sadness began to form over her.

<!-- like the world had lost its colors. She felt confused and a little scared. -->

**Suggestions:**
> - Describe the internal sensation physically. Use "how it feels" section from the emotional framework for corresponding emotion.
> - Show her automatic coping mechanism starting to kick in.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Tell) "Her ears drooped. The tip of her tail felt suddenly very heavy."
> Simile might be used here

**COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED**: Must show physical manifestation first, then brief label. Use Rainy Cloud metaphor.

---

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Recovery
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Liska seeking co-regulation and physical contact from mother. She gives her just a tiny bit, not full coregulation, but enough for her to act. -->

Liska instinctively sought comfort. She quietly padded over to her mother, who was sitting tensely, and leaned her small body against her mother's legs. Mara didn't turn around, but she reached down and rested a heavy paw on Liska's back—a silent, automatic gesture of connection. The solid weight was just enough to anchor Liska, even though the air in the den still felt sharp.

**Review:**
> This is a strong, developmentally appropriate depiction of a micro-moment of co-regulation. The parent is distracted but still responsive.

**Suggestions:**
> - Make the "heavy paw" a more specific, comforting sensory detail.
> - Emphasize that the comfort is real but incomplete.

### Beat 3.2: Attempt 1
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Like it's written, it's already a narration of what should be there.
-->

Feeling a bit more stable after the brief contact with her mother, Liska approached her father with her belt. Holding it up, she made a simple bid for connection: "Papa, look what I made." He glanced over, offered a distracted, "That's nice, sweetie," and turned away, his mind still on the argument. The failure to connect stung.

**Review:**
> A realistic first attempt and failure. The father's response can be made more visually distracted.

**Suggestions:**
> - Show the father's distraction with his gaze or posture.
> - Liska's presentation of the belt can be more hopeful and therefore more poignant when it fails.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **ADULT ANALYSIS**: "made a simple bid for connection" - too clinical
> - **TELLING**: "his mind still on the argument" - we can't know his thoughts
> - **ABSTRACT**: "The failure to connect stung" - show don't tell
> - **MISSING AGENCY**: Where's Liska's unique approach/personality?

**FOCUS**: Show Liska's hopeful action and Papa's physical distraction/words only.

### Beat 3.3: Attempt 2

Unwilling to give up, Liska stepped right in front of Papa, lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling slightly. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us." Papa finally looked at her, but his eyes were still stormy. He put his paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now. Mama and I need a quiet moment." No reassurance, just the soft push away. Liska's heart crumbled.
<!-- **Suggestions:**
> - Add a physical gesture from Liska, like tapping his hand with the belt.
> - The father's boundary-setting can be framed gently but firmly, which is 
what makes it so heartbreakingly final for her. -->

### Beat 3.4: Low Point

Liska ran to the hallway and collapsed into the tiniest ball she could make. Her whole body shook with big, gulpy sobs that came from deep in her belly. She pressed her face into her paws, treasure-braid clutched tight against her chest. She wanted to disappear into the floor, to become invisible, to stop feeling this terrible hurt.

### Beat 3.5: Recovery
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Her dysregulation is noticed by her father one way or another, in a way that makes sense from the narrative. It's all raw and heavily emotional still. He breaks away from the argument and comes to her. Co-regulates her. Reassures her. But then goes back into the room.

"We just need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" – this line is good
-->

Her father, Daric, saw her curled into a tight, trembling ball in the hallway. The sight pierced his own upset. He walked over, sat on the floor beside her, and placed a heavy, warm paw on her back. He waited until her trembling subsided, then said softly, "Mama and I... we have big, rumbly feelings sometimes. But our love for you, Liska, is never part of the rumble. We love you very much." He gave her a gentle squeeze, then added, "We just need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" He then got up and returned to the main room.

<!-- I'm not sure I like the whole "rumbly feelings" image. Is it clear for 4yo? Is it a vivid image? Is it natural for native english speakers? Doesn't sound natural for me -->

**Suggestions:**
> - Emphasize the father's silent presence first, before he speaks. The waiting is part of the support.
> - The father's action of returning to the talk is crucial for realism.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **ADULT PERSPECTIVE**: "The sight pierced his own upset" - we can't know Papa's internal state
> - **TOO LONG**: This co-regulation sequence risks exceeding the "3 exchanges maximum" rule
> - **ABSTRACT CONCEPTS**: "love...is never part of the rumble" may be too complex
> - **MISSING LISKA'S PARTICIPATION**: She needs to actively participate in her calming (agency)

### Beat 3.6: Re-evaluation
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Liska calms down a bit. Still miffed. Find further support in the braid, looks at the treasures. They remind her of family unity. She remembers the paw pile and gets determined to make parents do it.

should be a bridge from touching the braid "together" to remembering paw pile "together" and wanting to bring them "together"
-->


Alone again, Liska clutched her braid tight. The stone felt solid like Papa. The fur felt soft like Mama. The clay felt warm like home. She thought about their family paw pile - how they'd stack all their paws together and laugh. Her tears stopped. Her eyes got bright with determination. She knew exactly what to do!


**Suggestions:**
> - Make the moment of discovery a visual 'click' for the reader.
> - Use simple, action-oriented thought processes for Liska.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Internal thought) "I can't *show* them together. I have to *make* them together."

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **TOO ABSTRACT**: "what their love *felt* like" - not concrete for 4-5yo
> - **COMPLEX REASONING**: The metaphorical leap is too sophisticated
> - **ADULT NARRATION**: "formed in her mind" - too clinical
> - **NEEDS SIMPLER DISCOVERY**: Break down into smaller, concrete steps

---

## Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Final Attempt

Liska marched back into the room, braid clutched in one paw. She planted herself between her parents and declared: "LOOK! It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me!"

### Beat 4.2: Rising Tension

Her parents just stared. The room went so quiet Liska could hear her own heartbeat thumping like tiny rabbit feet.

### Beat 4.3: The Turning Point

Before they could speak, Liska grabbed Mama's paw. Then Papa's paw. She pulled them together with all her might and placed her own small paw on top. "Paw pile," she commanded. She pressed down firmly, then let the pile spring back up. "Us. Together," she said, her voice small but stubborn.

### Beat 4.4: Success

Her parents looked at their paws, then at each other, and then down at her. Something melted in their eyes. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug, right in the middle. "We're sorry we worried you," her mother whispered into her fur.

### Beat 4.5: Immediate Reward/Relief

A huge, happy sigh whooshed out of Liska. They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss - all three noses touching in the middle, making a perfect triangle of love. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

---

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Catharsis/Immediate Aftermath

They sat together in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring parent sandwich. 

<!-- can be better

Papa's chest rumbled with contented purrs. Mama's breathing was slow and peaceful again. -->

### Beat 5.2: Reflection & Learning

<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid and it's togetherness should finally click for both Liska and parents. Maybe here, maybe in the previous beat?
"Paw pile fixes rumbles" sound not bad, but is that a lesson we want the child to take away? 
Developmentally, it should be something along the lines "I can try and make things better?" But not analytical. Current phrase does that up to a point, but it attributes the solution to paw pile, not herself. 
 -->

Liska looked at their paws, still a pile. "Paw pile fixes rumbles," she announced with satisfaction. Father squeezed her gently. "Yes, it does," he said. "You remembered the most important thing."

<!-- Another option that I still don't like much
Liska looked down at their paws, still stacked together. "I made us remember," she said quietly, feeling proud. Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most." -->

### Beat 5.3: Making it Right/Integration
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Liska seeing/hearing parents making up, not *for* her, but between each other when they don't notice she's looking. 
Liska becomes content. 

That covers making it right. 

What would cover integration? She learned some lesson, how can she show it?
 -->

Later, Liska was half-dozing in the sunny corner when she heard her parents talking softly. "I'm sorry I was so prickly," said Father. Mother's voice was warm. "And I'm sorry I went so quiet.". Liska, without opening her eyes, felt the rumbles finally settle for good.

<!-- weak. Drop rumbles. Rewrite. -->

### Beat 5.4: New Status Quo

The next morning, Liska saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. He touched her shoulder gently as he set it down. Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes. The air smelled like cinnamon and felt warm again. Liska bounced between them, her treasure-braid swinging.

<!-- Conceptually correct, but not touching enough -->

### Beat 5.5: Concluding Thought
<!-- gentle pat is not endearing enough
conceptually right, but falls flat
 -->
Liska gave her treasure-braid a gentle pat. The stone, the fur, and the clay - all there. Together.
