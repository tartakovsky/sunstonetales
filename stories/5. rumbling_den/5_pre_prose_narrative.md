## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere

The family house was bathed in early morning golden light streaming through the windows. The air was warm and cozy. In the back garden, there was a special sunny corner where the family often curled up together, creating a sense of safety and happiness.

<!-- What's important in the beat:
Special sunny corner in the back garden. Safety and happiness atmosphere.
 -->

**Review:**
> A solid, warm opening. It could be made slightly more evocative by adding more sensory details beyond just sight and temperature.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **LENGTH VIOLATION**: Beat 1.1 must be 1-2 lines maximum. This is 3 sentences.
> - **MISSING STORYTELLING INTRO**: Must start with "That day Liska", "One morning in Sunstone", etc. "One day / Однажды" would be good here.
> - **TOO ABSTRACT**: "sense of safety and happiness" is telling, not concrete sensory detail
> - **NO IMMEDIATE HOOK**: Lacks the required "aww/ooh/laugh" response trigger
> - **PASSIVE DESCRIPTION**: No movement or action to create engagement

### Beat 1.2: Introduce character(s)
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Brain. She's in the sunny corner from beat 1. The treasures should be specifically these and extremely emotionally resonant.
 -->

Liska sat in the sunny corner, focused intently on finishing a small, thick belt. It was made of three braided strands. Woven into it were her greatest treasures: a small, rainbow 'courage stone' her father had given her. A tuft of her own white baby-fur that her mother had saved and tied with a silver thread. And a tiny, hardened clay tablet bearing her own first paw-print.

**Suggestions:**
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Whispering to the belt) "There. Now you are all safe together."

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **TELLING NOT SHOWING**: "focused intently" - show through action instead
> - **MISSING PERSONALITY**: What makes Liska uniquely Liska here?

**REWRITE NEEDED**: Focus on one endearing action that shows personality: "Liska's tiny tongue poked out as she tied the last knot. She held up her treasure-braid and [gave it a satisfied nod.]"

---

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid done. Family treasures all together. Tying like a belt is not necessary. She's proud and happy. Really wants to show her parents.
 -->


Her treasure-braid was finally done, tied snug around her waist. It felt like a warm hug. She bounced on her paws, a happy little wiggle starting in her tail. She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parents tense, tense pre-conflict atmosphere
 -->

Liska entered the main room to find her parents with stiff tails and serious faces, not looking at each other. The air felt still and sharp. This was unusual and unsettling for her.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **ADULT PERSPECTIVE**: "serious faces" is adult interpretation
> - **TELLING**: "This was unusual and unsettling" - show don't tell
> - **NOT A CATALYST**: This is observation, not the triggering action/event
> - **ABSTRACT**: "air felt still and sharp" - needs concrete sensory detail

**NEEDS CLARITY**: What is the actual catalyst here? Is it Liska entering? The parents' state? Be specific about the triggering moment.

> The catalyst is Liska entering and feeling the tension in the room

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parental conflict shown. It hurts Liska. 
 -->

Liska hesitated, then heard her father's voice, a low rumble, "I just don't understand why." Her mother's voice was a sharp whisper from across the room, "I can't talk about this now." The conflict was now undeniable.

**Review:**
> The dialogue confirmed the conflict, but it was very adult-centric. We can rephrase it to be more about the *sound* and *feeling* of the words from Liska's perspective, rather than the content.

**Suggestions:**
> - Liska might not understand the words, but she should understand the *feeling* of them perfectly.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **TELLING**: "The conflict is now undeniable" - show don't tell
> - **ADULT-CENTRIC**: Dialogue content too complex for child perspective
> - **NO PHYSICAL IMPACT**: Where's the immediate physical/emotional effect on Liska?
> - **MISSING STAKES**: How does this problem affect Liska specifically?

### Beat 2.4: Fallout
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Liska's initial dysregulation, not heavy yet, more confusion, a bit of saddness and fear. Emotions shown. Not sure we need rainy cloud specifically, just a simile might be okay  -->

Liska experienced initial dysregulation. Confusion and sadness began to form over her.

**Suggestions:**
> - Describe the internal sensation physically. Use "how it feels" section from the emotional framework for corresponding emotion.
> - Show her automatic coping mechanism starting to kick in.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Tell) "Her ears drooped. The tip of her tail felt suddenly very heavy."
> Simile might be used here

**COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED**: Must show physical manifestation first, then brief label. Use Rainy Cloud metaphor.

---

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Recovery
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Liska seeking co-regulation and physical contact from mother. She gives her just a tiny bit, not full coregulation, but enough for her to act. -->

Liska instinctively sought comfort. She quietly padded over to her mother, who was sitting tensely, and leaned her small body against her mother's legs. Mara didn't turn around, but she reached down and rested a heavy paw on Liska's back—a silent, automatic gesture of connection. The solid weight was just enough to anchor Liska, even though the air in the den still felt sharp.

**Review:**
> This is a strong, developmentally appropriate depiction of a micro-moment of co-regulation. The parent is distracted but still responsive.

**Suggestions:**
> - Make the "heavy paw" a more specific, comforting sensory detail.
> - Emphasize that the comfort is real but incomplete.

### Beat 3.2: Attempt 1
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Like it's written, it's already a narration of what should be there.
-->

Feeling a bit more stable after the brief contact with her mother, Liska approached her father with her belt. Holding it up, she made a simple bid for connection: "Papa, look what I made." He glanced over, offered a distracted, "That's nice, sweetie," and turned away, his mind still on the argument. The failure to connect stung.

**Review:**
> A realistic first attempt and failure. The father's response can be made more visually distracted.

**Suggestions:**
> - Show the father's distraction with his gaze or posture.
> - Liska's presentation of the belt can be more hopeful and therefore more poignant when it fails.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **ADULT ANALYSIS**: "made a simple bid for connection" - too clinical
> - **TELLING**: "his mind still on the argument" - we can't know his thoughts
> - **ABSTRACT**: "The failure to connect stung" - show don't tell
> - **MISSING AGENCY**: Where's Liska's unique approach/personality?

**FOCUS**: Show Liska's hopeful action and Papa's physical distraction/words only.

### Beat 3.3: Attempt 2

<!-- What's important in the beat:
Determination after first failure. 
"No, Papa, *look*," she 
insisted, her voice trembling slightly. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's 
us." – this exact phrase.

Father notices her now, but still can't get out of the argument. Tells her not right now, no reassurance. That dysregulates Liska fully and she runs away.
-->

Unwilling to give up, Liska tried again, this time with more urgency. She stepped in front of him and held the belt out. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling slightly. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us." The directness of her plea, her attempt to force him to see the symbol, was too much for his frayed state. He gently stopped her: "Liska, sweetie, not right now. Mama and I need a quiet moment." He set a boundary but offered no reassurance. This dismissal of her precious symbol was what truly broke her heart and sent her into her emotional low point.


**Suggestions:**
> - Add a physical gesture from Liska, like tapping his hand with the belt.
> - The father's boundary-setting can be framed gently but firmly, which is what makes it so heartbreakingly final for her.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Liska's voice) "'It's our family,' she whispered, her voice full of hope and wobble."
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Father's action) "He gently put his paw over hers, stopping her. A soft wall."
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Internal) "His words didn't just stop her hands. They stopped her heart."
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Liska, pleading) "'But... it's the together-part.'"

### Beat 3.4: Low Point
<!-- What's important in the beat:

No Rainy Cloud. Should be pure, raw, emotional low point, fully showing her dysregulation. Curling on the floor, sobbing ball of fur are good. 
-->

She ran out, started crying and curled down on the floor into a little sobbing ball of fur. Overwhelmed as her 'Rainy Cloud' became a heavy storm.

**Review:**
> Clear, but we can make the emotional storm more visceral and sensory.

**Suggestions:**
> - Describe the feeling of her body curling up—the need to be small and disappear.
> - Add sounds—the specific type of sobs.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** "She ran until the 'right now' was gone and curled up into the smallest possible ball of sad."
> - **Punchy Snippet:** "Her body shook with little hiccup-sobs that had no words."
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Metaphor) "The Rainy Cloud wasn't drizzling anymore. It was a big, thumpy, splashy storm, and she was all wet inside."

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **METAPHOR INTRODUCTION**: 'Rainy Cloud' appears without proper introduction
> - **GENERIC DESCRIPTION**: "little sobbing ball of fur" - needs specific Liska details
> - **LENGTH**: Too short for emotional nadir (needs 3-7 lines)
> - **MISSING PRACTICAL FAILURE**: What's the practical setback beyond crying?

### Beat 3.5: Recovery
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Her dysregulation is noticed by her father one way or another, in a way that makes sense from the narrative. It's all raw and heavily emotional still. He breaks away from the argument and comes to her. Co-regulates her. Reassures her. But then goes back into the room.

"We just need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" – this line is good
-->

Her father, Daric, saw her curled into a tight, trembling ball in the hallway. The sight pierced his own upset. He walked over, sat on the floor beside her, and placed a heavy, warm paw on her back. He waited until her trembling subsided, then said softly, "Mama and I... we have big, rumbly feelings sometimes. But our love for you, Liska, is never part of the rumble. We love you very much." He gave her a gentle squeeze, then added, "We just need to finish talking. Can you wait for us?" He then got up and returned to the main room.

**Review:**
> This is a stellar example of high-quality co-regulation. The dialogue is perfect. "Rumbly feelings" is a fantastic, child-friendly term.

**Suggestions:**
> - Emphasize the father's silent presence first, before he speaks. The waiting is part of the support.
> - The father's action of returning to the talk is crucial for realism.

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **ADULT PERSPECTIVE**: "The sight pierced his own upset" - we can't know Papa's internal state
> - **TOO LONG**: This co-regulation sequence risks exceeding the "3 exchanges maximum" rule
> - **ABSTRACT CONCEPTS**: "love...is never part of the rumble" may be too complex
> - **MISSING LISKA'S PARTICIPATION**: She needs to actively participate in her calming (agency)

### Beat 3.6: Re-evaluation
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Liska calms down a bit. Still miffed. Find further support in the braid, looks at the treasures. They remind her of family unity. She remembers the paw pile and gets determined to make parents do it.
-->


Grounded by her father's words, Liska's thoughts turned to what their love *felt* like. She clutched her little braid, feeling the stone, the fur, and the clay tablet. The solution wasn't showing them the braid; it was making them *become* the braid. The idea of a "Paw Pile" formed in her mind.


**Suggestions:**
> - Make the moment of discovery a visual 'click' for the reader.
> - Use simple, action-oriented thought processes for Liska.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** (Internal thought) "I can't *show* them together. I have to *make* them together."

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **TOO ABSTRACT**: "what their love *felt* like" - not concrete for 4-5yo
> - **COMPLEX REASONING**: The metaphorical leap is too sophisticated
> - **ADULT NARRATION**: "formed in her mind" - too clinical
> - **NEEDS SIMPLER DISCOVERY**: Break down into smaller, concrete steps

## Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1-4.3: Final Attempt, Rising Tension, and Turning Point
<!-- What's important in the beat:

She goes back in. 
She declares exact phrase: "LOOK! It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me!"

Forces their paws together. Commands paw pile. When they put down paws together:
She pressed on them and said "Together" in small but stubborn voice.

Might be good to split it back into three beats
1) back in, look it's us
2) small one sentence tension where the parents don't immediately react
3) turning point where she forces them together and commands paw pile
-->

Liska uncurled, her braid clutched in one paw. She marched into the room and declared, "LOOK! It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me!"

Before they could react, she walked to her mother and took her paw. She went to her father and took his. She brought their paws together, commanded "Paw pile," and placed her own paw on top of theirs. She pressed the pile down firmly, then let it spring back up, punctuating the point.

"Together," she said, her voice small but full of power.

### Beat 4.4: Success
<!-- What's important in the beat:
more or less it. [The rumbly quitet] phrase is very weak. 
Invisible wall is too adult metaphor. 
Her parents looked at their paws, then at each other, and then down at her. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug, right in the middle. - keep as is
"We're sorry we worried you," her mother whispered into her fur. - keep as is
-->

The rumbly quiet broke. Her parents looked at their paws, then at each other, and then down at her. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug, right in the middle. The big, invisible wall was gone. "We're sorry we worried you," her mother whispered into her fur.

### Beat 4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief
<!-- What's important in the beat:

As narrated, but with show not tell and sensory detail
 -->

Liska experienced a strong positive emotional release. They sealed their reunion with their special "Triple Kiss"—all three of them touching noses and kissing each other simultaneously in a triangle of love.


**Suggestions:**
> - Describe the release of tension in Liska's body.
> - Make the "Triple Kiss" a multi-sensory moment of warmth, soft fur, and gentle sound.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** "A big, happy sigh she didn't know she was holding whooshed out of her."

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Catharsis / Immediate Aftermath

<!-- What's important in the beat:


They sat together in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring parent sandwich. – write exactly as is

Maybe some other punchy sensory detail


 -->


Tension subsided as the family sat together in the sunny corner in the garden, with Liska curled up safely between them.

**Suggestions:**
> - Reinforce the return of the positive sensory details from the beginning.
> - Show their physical closeness—not just sitting together, but curled up and connected.
> - **Punchy Snippet:** "Liska was the filling in a warm, purring parent sandwich."

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
> - **TELLING**: "Tension subsided" - show don't tell
> - **GENERIC**: Needs specific sensory details unique to this family
> - **TOO SHORT**: Beat 5.1 needs 2-3 lines
> - **MISSING PHYSICAL RELAXATION**: Show bodies unwinding, not just sitting

### Beat 5.2: Reflection & Learning

<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid and it's togetherness should finally click for both Liska and parents. Maybe here, maybe in the previous beat?
"Paw pile fixes rumbles" sound not bad, but is that a lesson we want the child to take away? 
Developmentally, it should be something along the lines "I can try and make things better?" But not analytical. Current phrase does that up to a point, but it attributes the solution to paw pile, not herself. 
 -->

Liska looked at their paws, still a pile. "Paw pile fixes rumbles," she announced with satisfaction. Father squeezed her gently. "Yes, it does," he said. "You remembered the most important thing."

### Beat 5.3: Making it Right/Integration
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Liska seeing/hearing parents making up, not *for* her, but between each other when they don't notice she's looking. 
Liska becomes content. 

That covers making it right. 

What would cover integration? She learned some lesson, how can she show it?
 -->

Later, Liska was half-dozing in the sunny corner when she heard her parents talking softly. "I'm sorry I was so prickly," said Father. Mother's voice was warm. "And I'm sorry I went so quiet." There was a soft touch of paws. Liska, without opening her eyes, felt the rumbles finally settle for good.

### Beat 5.4: New Status Quo
<!-- What's important in the beat:

More or less it, new sense of normality where parents like each other again, notice Liska and smile to each other.
-->

The next morning, Liska saw her father bring her mother a cup of tea. He touched her shoulder gently as he set it down. She looked up at him, and her eyes crinkled in a real smile. The air felt warm and smelled of cinnamon again.

### Beat 5.5: Concluding Thought
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Pretty much it. Must end with together. Maybe braid, not belt. Maybe not patted, something more endearing. 

Must keep: 
- The stone, the fur, and the clay
- Together.
-->
Liska patted her treasure-belt. The stone, the fur, and the clay were all still there. She gave it a little squeeze. Together.
