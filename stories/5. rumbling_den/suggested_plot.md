  - A favorite shell slips and gets a tiny chip; Liska feels sad, shows it to Mother Mara.
  - Mara acknowledges Liska's sadness, points to a family picture on the wall.
  - Mara guides Liska to recall a happy memory linked to the picture; Liska's mood lifts.
  - Mara explains using happy memories to balance sad feelings, seeding the "Sunbeam" concept.
  - <!-- NOTE: This is a micro co-regulation scene. Its structural purpose is to seed the core coping mechanism Liska will use in Act 4, solving the "unearned solution" flaw from the audit. It is not the main regulation cycle. -->
