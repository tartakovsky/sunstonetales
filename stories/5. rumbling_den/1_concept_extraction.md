## Goal of the Story

This story addresses the universal challenge of family conflict from a child's perspective—how witnessing parental tension triggers confusion, sadness, and fear of abandonment in young children. We're teaching the reader that even when parents have disagreements (their "rumbly feelings"), the family bond remains strong, and children can play an active role in healing disconnection. The problem we're addressing is the emotional dysregulation and helplessness children experience when their secure base feels threatened by parental conflict. Our solution offers a child-centered approach: recognizing and expressing feelings of sadness and need for togetherness, using concrete actions (the "paw pile" ritual) to physically manifest family unity, and learning that love persists through difficult moments. We present this through the metaphor of "braiding" family members together because it transforms an abstract concept of unity into something tangible a child can understand and recreate, empowering them to be agents of reconnection rather than passive victims of adult conflict.

## Synopsis

Liska creates a special braided belt containing family treasures—her father's courage stone, her mother's saved tuft of baby fur, and her own paw print—representing their family bond. When she enters the main room to show her parents, she finds them tense and distant, speaking in sharp tones that make the air feel cold and wrong. Her attempts to connect with them fail; her father dismisses her precious creation with distracted words, breaking her heart and triggering a "Rainy Cloud" of overwhelming sadness.

After crying alone, her father finds her and provides crucial co-regulation, explaining that parents sometimes have "big, rumbly feelings" between them but their love for her never wavers. This grounds Liska enough to realize that showing them the braid isn't enough—she needs to make them "become" the braid. She bravely marches back, takes both parents' hands, and creates a "paw pile," pressing their hands together while declaring "Together." This physical act breaks through their emotional distance, leading to apologies, their special "Triple Kiss" ritual, and a deeper understanding that families can have conflicts while still maintaining their essential bond. The story concludes with Liska witnessing her parents' gentle reconciliation, feeling secure in the knowledge that their family braid holds strong even through rumbles.

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** Liska experiences emotional dysregulation (confusion and sadness) when witnessing her parents' tense conflict, feeling disconnected from her secure family base.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** The parental tension creates emotional distance throughout the family system—Liska feels isolated and fears she might be the cause or target of the conflict, while the parents are so absorbed in their disagreement that they fail to notice their child's emotional needs, creating a breakdown in the family's typical warmth and connection.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** Liska learns to actively express her emotional needs and use symbolic action (the paw pile ritual) to remind her parents of their family bond, facilitating reconnection.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** Liska develops the ability to recognize her sadness, seek co-regulation when needed, and then take brave action by using clear words ("We are family. Together.") combined with physical connection rituals to express her need for family unity.

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  
**A:**
- **Confusion → Sadness:** When Liska encounters the tense atmosphere and her parents' cold interaction, confusion about the changed dynamic leads to deep sadness.
- **Disappointment → Sadness:** When her father dismisses her precious braided belt without truly seeing it, the disappointment of failed connection deepens her sadness.
- **Sadness → Withdrawal:** Overwhelmed by the "Rainy Cloud," Liska runs away and curls into a ball, demonstrating the withdrawal response to overwhelming sadness.

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** The emotions are absolutely central to the story. This is fundamentally about learning to recognize, express, and manage the sadness that comes from witnessing family conflict, and discovering that expressing emotional needs can help restore connection.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** **Sadness** is the key emotion. Developmentally, this is crucial because:
- Children need to learn that sadness from family conflict is valid and can be expressed
- Understanding that they can take action when feeling sad (rather than just withdrawing) builds emotional agency
- Learning to seek connection when sad, rather than isolating, is a fundamental social-emotional skill
- Recognizing that family love persists through sad moments prevents lasting emotional damage from witnessing conflict

---

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** Sadness is represented by the **"Rainy Cloud" (Дождливая Тучка)** metaphor from the Emotional Framework. This captures:
- The heavy, grey feeling that descends over everything
- The sense of being under something oppressive
- The way sadness can feel like an internal storm
- The physical heaviness and the tears that want to fall like rain

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** The primary learned coping behavior is **"Talking About My Feeling"** combined with taking symbolic action. Liska learns to:
- Express her sadness and need for connection through words ("We are family. Together.")
- Use physical ritual (the paw pile) to manifest her emotional needs
- Transform from passive recipient of family tension to active agent of reconnection
This teaches children that they can voice their needs during family conflicts and that their expressed feelings have the power to remind adults of what truly matters.

**11. Write a paragraph summarizing the story.**  
**A:** In "Rumbling Den," Liska creates a braided belt containing family treasures to represent their unity, but discovers her parents locked in tense conflict, speaking in sharp tones and avoiding each other. When her attempts to share her creation are dismissed, she's overwhelmed by a "Rainy Cloud" of sadness and runs away crying. Her father finds her and explains that parents sometimes have "rumbly feelings" but their love for her never changes. Inspired by her braided belt, Liska bravely returns to create a physical "paw pile" with her parents' hands, declaring "Together!" This breaks through their emotional distance, leading to a family reconciliation with their special "Triple Kiss." The next morning, witnessing her parents' gentle interactions, Liska understands that families can have conflicts but their love—like her braided belt—holds them together through any rumble.
