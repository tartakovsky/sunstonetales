My previous explanation was too absolute. It's not that her understanding of the world is broken, but that she has encountered a situation for which she has no existing mental model.
Let's refine the analysis based on your points:
She is adaptable and has multiple "maps" for the yard: You're right. She has a "Day Yard" map, a "Quiet Night Yard" map, a "Playtime Yard" map, etc. Each comes with a set of expected sensory inputs (sights, sounds, smells) and rules of engagement.
The Core Problem is a "Map Mismatch": The festival is a new configuration that doesn't match any of her existing maps. When she enters, her brain tries to load the appropriate model:
It tries to load the "Night Yard" map, but the sounds are loud and festive, not quiet crickets. The lights are dynamic and colorful, not steady moonlight. Mismatch.
It tries to load the "Playtime Yard" map, but the space is filled with blankets, stalls, and unfamiliar adults, not open for running. The rules of movement are different. Mismatch.
Unpredictability is the Source of Fear: Because none of her trusted maps fit, she loses the ability to predict what will happen next. This is the fundamental source of her fear. It's not the darkness or the people themselves, but the fact that she doesn't know the rules of this new environment. For a child, this inability to predict creates a state of high-alert anxiety. Every unpredictable element—a new sound, a stranger's movement—is a potential threat because it's an unknown variable.

You are absolutely right. My apologies for not being precise enough. Let's move away from the narrative and focus entirely on the internal, moment-to-moment psychological experience of a real five-year-old in this situation.

Here is what the child would specifically feel, broken down into distinct internal experiences.

### 1. The Loss of "Autopilot" and The Onset of Cognitive Load

*   **What it feels like:** Normally, when Liska crosses the yard, she's on autopilot. She doesn't think about where to place her paws; she just *knows*. Her brain has this task so heavily optimized that it requires zero conscious effort.
*   **The specific feeling:** Now, that autopilot is offline. Every single step requires intense, conscious calculation. "Is that a shadow or a hole? Is the ground bumpy there? Can I step on that?" This sudden, massive cognitive load is mentally exhausting. The child feels a specific kind of mental "heaviness" or "slowness." It feels like trying to walk through thick mud. The fear isn't just of the shadows; it's the paralyzing effort of having to think about something that was once effortless.

### 2. The "It's Not Listening to Me" Feeling (Failure of Agency)

*   **What it feels like:** A child's mastery of a space is a form of control. They know that if they run from A to B, the result is predictable. The environment "listens" to their actions in a consistent way.
*   **The specific feeling:** The festival yard is "not listening." The sounds don't quiet when she wants them to. The lights and shadows move on their own, ignoring her. She tries to impose her will—by walking, looking, or trying to understand—but the environment is completely unresponsive to her efforts. This creates a specific feeling of powerlessness, like a mild form of vertigo. It feels like the world is "broken" or "cheating." This is profoundly frustrating and frightening.

### 3. The Sensory Hierarchy Inversion

*   **What it feels like:** In a familiar environment, a child relies on a trusted hierarchy of senses. For navigation, sight is primary. Hearing provides background confirmation of safety (e.g., the sound of crickets). Touch and smell are secondary.
*   **The specific feeling:** The festival inverts this.
    *   **Sight is now unreliable:** The primary sense for navigation is feeding her confusing, untrustworthy data.
    *   **Hearing is now an assault:** The background sense that should signal "all is well" is now a source of sharp, unpredictable, and overwhelming noise.
    *   A child in this state would feel a specific need to fall back on their most primal, close-range sense: **touch**. This is why the urge to run back and physically touch the parent—the ultimate predictable, safe object—becomes overwhelming. The feeling is, "My eyes and ears are lying to me; I need to touch something real."

### 4. The Shrinking of "Safe Space"

*   **What it feels like:** For a child, "safe space" is not just the physical proximity to a parent. It's a bubble of predictability they carry with them. In the familiar yard, that bubble is large; the entire yard is "hers."
*   **The specific feeling:** In the festival, that bubble of predictable, safe space shrinks dramatically until it is only the space immediately occupied by her own body, and even that feels assaulted by the unpredictable sounds and lights. The feeling is a type of claustrophobia, but in reverse. The world feels too big, too loud, and too close, while her personal zone of control has shrunk to almost nothing. This is why she would physically retreat—to pull the chaotic, unpredictable world back to a manageable distance and re-establish a "safe space" by making physical contact with her mother.
