### Beat 3.2: Attempt 1 (Initial Reaction / Less Considered Approach)
- Liska attempts to solve her problem by blaming her friends. She runs to her mother, Mara, and complains that they wouldn't help her.

### Beat 3.3: Attempt 2 (Developing Approach / New Complication)
- Liska makes two distinct, partial attempts to apply her mother's advice, but fails to fully regulate her behavior, showing that the problem is more complex.
- **Attempt A (The Beach):** The next day, Liska invites her friends to continue the treasure hunt. When a plan doesn't work, she tries to speak calmly, but her voice gets louder and her tail twitches with agitation, causing her friends to keep their distance.
- **Attempt B (The School):** At school, while sharing art supplies, Lucia accidentally breaks a crayon. Liska feels anger rising again. She takes a breath and speaks calmly, but her tense body language makes her friends hesitate to fully engage with her.

- The second regulation cycle occurs with her mother. Mara validated her feelings and normalizes the difficulty of rebuilding trust, explaining, "Remember how you feel after you've been upset? You can't calm down right away." She helps Liska co-regulate, calming her down so she can think clearly.

### Beat 4.3: The Turning Point / Final Push (Demonstrating Growth in Action)
