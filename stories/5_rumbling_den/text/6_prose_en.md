## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Special sunny corner in the back garden. Safety and happiness atmosphere.

Braid. She's in the sunny corner. The treasures should be specifically these and extremely emotionally resonant.
 -->

In a sunny corner of the garden, where the air smelled like warm earth and honeybees buzzed over clover, Liska sat with her treasures. She worked with great care, her little brow furrowed in concentration as she finished a small, thick braid. Woven into it was a rainbow ‘courage stone’ from Papa, a tuft of her own white baby-fur saved by Mama, and a tiny clay tablet with her very first paw-print. Her first mark on the world. 

She held it up to the light, then whispered to the treasures, "There. Now you're all safe together."

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid done. Family treasures all together. Tying like a belt is not necessary. She's proud and happy. Really wants to show her parents.
 -->

Her treasure-braid was finally done. It felt like a warm hug against her fur. She bounced on her paws, a happy little wiggle starting in her tail. She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parents tense, tense pre-conflict atmosphere
 -->

Liska bounded into the main room and skidded to a stop. 

The air in the room was still and heavy. Papa stood by the window, his tail as stiff as a stick. Mama sat far away, her face turned to the wall. The happy bounce in Liska’s paws fizzled out.

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parental conflict shown. It hurts Liska. Show mild dysregulation - miffed and sad but not overwhelming
 -->

<!-- A specific line can be better here of how the conflict is shown of the dialogue.  -->
Liska hesitated. Papa’s voice was a low rumble. "I just don't understand why."

From across the room, Mama’s voice was a sharp whisper. "I can't talk about this now."

Liska's ears drooped. The happy wiggle in her tail died completely. A tight little squeeze took hold of her chest, making it hard to breathe. She felt very, very sad.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Merging the two attempts. First approach to father fails, then more insistent approach also fails.
-->

She padded over to Papa and held up her braid. "Papa, look what I made."

He glanced down. "That's nice, sweetie." His eyes were already looking back out the window. Liska flinched, as if pricked by a thorn.

She stepped right in front of him, blocking his view and lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us."

Papa looked at her but his gaze was stormy. He put a paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now." His paw pushed hers softly away. Liska’s breath caught in her throat.

### Beat 3.2: Low Point

Liska sniffed and ran out of the room. She collapsed in the hallway, curling into the tiniest, tightest ball she could make. Her whole body shook with big, gulpy sobs that came from deep in her belly. She pressed her face into her paws, wanting to disappear right into the floor.

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

Papa’s warm shadow fell over her. He sat on the floor and rested a heavy, warm paw on her back, saying nothing. He just sat with her, breathing slowly, until her big sobs turned into little hiccups.

"I see you are very sad," he said softly. "Mama and I... we are very angry. But it is not your fault. We love you." He squeezed her gently. "Can you do something for me? Hold your special braid and take one deep, slow breath, like we practiced. Can you do that while we finish talking?" He helped her sit up and hugged her. Liska nodded into his shoulder. Papa squezeed her one last time and went back to the room.

### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation
<!-- What's important in the beat:

Liska calms down a bit. Still miffed. Find further support in the braid, looks at the treasures. They remind her of family unity. She remembers the paw pile and gets determined to make parents do it.

should be a bridge from touching the braid "together" to remembering paw pile "together" and wanting to bring them "together"
-->
Her hiccups slowly quieted. For a long moment, she just sat there, tracing the treasures on her braid with one paw. The stone felt solid, like Papa. The fur felt soft, like Mama. The clay felt warm, like home. *Together*. A tiny spark of an idea began to glow. 

She remembered their family paw pile... How they’d stack all their paws and laugh.

---

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

Liska marched back into the room. She planted her paws between her parents and held up the braid. "LOOK!" she declared. "It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me!"

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback

Her parents just stared. The room went so quiet Liska could hear her own heartbeat, a fast, strong thumping in her chest.

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested -> Learned Skill -> Persistence

That prickly, sad feeling started to creep back into her chest. She took a tiny, shaky breath. *'I can try,'* she told herself.

Before her parents could speak, she grabbed Mama's paw. Then she grabbed Papa's. She pulled them together with all her might and placed her own small paw right on top.

"Paw pile," she commanded, her voice small but stubborn. "Us. Together."

### Beat 4.4: Success

Her parents looked at their paws, then at each other. Then they looked down at her. Something in their eyes melted. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug.

"We're so sorry we worried you," Mama whispered into her fur.

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief

A huge, happy sigh whooshed out of Liska. They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss—all three noses touching in the middle. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid and its togetherness should finally click for both Liska and parents.
Developmentally, it should be something along the lines "I can try and make things better?" But not analytical. Focus on her agency in bringing them together.
 -->

They sat together in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring parent sandwich. She looked at their paws, still stacked together.

"I made us remember," she said quietly, a proud little puff in her chest.

Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most."

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Liska seeing/hearing parents making up between each other when they don't notice she's looking. 
Show the new status quo - harmony restored
Integration - she uses her knowledge somehow
 -->

Later, Liska was half-dozing when she heard her parents talking softly.

"I'm sorry I was so sharp," said Papa.

"And I'm sorry I went so quiet," Mama’s voice replied, warm as honey.

She saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. As he set it down, he touched Mama's shoulder, and Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes. The air felt warm again. 


### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
<!-- Make it more emotionally resonant and endearing -->
Her treasure-braid swung at her side as she played. Stone, fur, clay. Her family. And her, brave enough to bring them all together.
