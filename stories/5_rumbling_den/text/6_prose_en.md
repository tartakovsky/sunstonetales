## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Special sunny corner in the back garden. Safety and happiness atmosphere.

Braid. She's in the sunny corner. The treasures should be specifically these and extremely emotionally resonant.
 -->
<!-- 
ANALYZER'S NOTES: This beat is too descriptive and slow. It needs to be condensed to get to the action faster while still establishing the braid's importance.

**Line [10]: "In a sunny corner of the garden, where the air smelled like warm earth and honeybees buzzed over clover, Liska sat with her treasures."**
- **Function:** Essential Context
- **Problems:** Unnecessary atmospheric details, passive ("Liska sat"), tells instead of shows. Violates "Descriptions without character interaction."
- **Verdict:** MERGE/REWRITE
- **Alternative:** Merge setting directly into character action. "Liska finished her treasure-braid in a sunny corner of the garden, weaving in..."

**Line [10]: "She worked with great care, her little brow furrowed in concentration as she finished a small, thick braid."**
- **Function:** Character Action
- **Problems:** Redundant. "Great care" and "furrowed in concentration" say the same thing. Can be shown more actively.
- **Verdict:** MERGE
- **Alternative:** Combine with the previous and next lines to show the action and its components together.

**Line [12]: "She held it up to the light, then whispered to the treasures, 'There. Now you're all safe together.'"**
- **Function:** Character Action
- **Problems:** "held it up to the light" is a generic action.
- **Verdict:** REWRITE
- **Alternative:** Make the action more specific to the character and the object. "She hugged the braid to her chest" or "She ran a paw over the treasures."

#### Page 1
<!-- Image: Liska kneels over braid and treasures in the grass, looking at them lovingly -->
In a sunny corner of the garden, where the air smelled like warm earth and honeybees buzzed over clover, Liska sat with her treasures. 

#### Page 2
<!-- Image: She lies down on her stomach, lower paws up, working on her braid with concentration -->
She worked with great care, her little brow furrowed in concentration as she finished a small, thick braid. 

#### Page 3
<!-- Image: close up of the treasures? -->
Woven into it was a rainbow 'courage stone' from Papa, a tuft of her own white baby-fur saved by Mama, and a tiny clay tablet with her very first paw-print. Her first mark on the world.

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid done. Family treasures all together. Tying like a belt is not necessary. She's proud and happy. Really wants to show her parents.
 -->

#### Page 4
<!-- Image: holds up the finished braids up, happy face -->
She held it up to the light, then whispered to the treasures, "There. Now you're all safe together."

#### Page 5
<!-- Image: Liska running home? -->
Her treasure-braid was finally done. Liska hugged it tight and bounced on her paws, her tail wiggling. She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parents tense, tense pre-conflict atmosphere
 -->

#### Page 6
<!-- Image: Liska in the doorway, stopped, wide eyes, unpleasant surprise. Father and mother stiff -->
Liska bounded into the main room and skidded to a stop. 

Papa stood by the window, his tail as stiff as a stick. Mama sat far away, her face turned to the wall.

<!-- This dialogue needs to be shortened significantly or dropped completely -->
Liska hesitated. Papa's voice was a low rumble. "I just don't understand why."

From across the room, Mama's voice was a sharp whisper. "I can't talk about this now."

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parental conflict shown. It hurts Liska. Show mild dysregulation - miffed and sad but not overwhelming
 -->

#### Page 7
<!-- Image: Liska miffed, ears down -->
Liska's ears drooped. The happy wiggle in her tail stopped. A tight little squeeze took hold of her chest, making it hard to breathe.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Merging the two attempts. First approach to father fails, then more insistent approach also fails.
-->

#### Page 8
<!-- Image: Liska and Papa. She holds out her braid hesitantly. Papa doesn't pay attention -->
She padded over to Papa and held up her braid. "Papa, look what I made."

He glanced down. "That's nice, sweetie." His eyes were already looking back out the window. Liska flinched, as if pricked by a thorn.

#### Page 9
<!-- Image: Liska stands in front of father. Determined expression. Shoves the braid into his face. Talks to him.  -->
She stepped right in front of him, blocking his view and lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us."

#### Page 10
<!-- Image: Papa holds her paw with two paws, lookes her in the eyes, frowns, says not right now  -->
Papa looked at her but his gaze was stormy. He put a paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now." 

#### Page 11
<!-- Image: father holds her by the shoulders, turning her away, slightly pushing her back-->
His paw pushed hers softly away. Liska's breath caught in her throat.

### Beat 3.2: Low Point

#### Page 12
<!-- Less dysregulation? We need her to recover without full co-regulation from parents. Maybe she doesn't curl into a ball in despair. Just sits sad in the corner, hugging her knees. -->
Liska sniffed and ran out of the room. She collapsed in the hallway, curling into the tiniest, tightest ball she could make. Her whole body shook with big, gulpy sobs that came from deep in her belly. She pressed her face into her paws, wanting to disappear right into the floor.

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

<!-- That needs a rewrite. So he comes in, sits with her, hugs her, labels the emotion, names it. That's like, yeah, you're very sad, then validates it, like I would be sad too, or, yeah, that's good. Then he explains. We keep the, it's not your fault, little one, we love you. Then we need to condense. the rest. So he helps her sit up, asks her something very short, like, hold your breath, can you take a slow breath for me? Then he asks her, like, can you do that for me while we finish talking? She nods. He squeezes her last time and goes back to the room.  -->

#### Page 13
Papa's warm shadow fell over her. He sat on the floor and rested a heavy, warm paw on her back, saying nothing. He just sat with her, breathing slowly, until her big sobs turned into little hiccups.

#### Page 14
"I see you are very sad," he said softly. "Mama and I... we are very angry. But it is not your fault, little one, we love you." He squeezed her gently. "Can you do something for me? Hold your special braid and take one deep, slow breath, like we practiced. Can you do that while we finish talking?" He helped her sit up and hugged her. Liska nodded into his shoulder. Papa squezeed her one last time and went back to the room.

### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation
#### Page 15
<!-- Image: Liska still sad, looks at the braid on the floor, touches it -->
Her hiccups slowly quieted. For a long moment, she just sat there, tracing the treasures on her braid with one paw. The stone felt solid, like Papa. The fur felt soft, like Mama. The clay felt warm, like home. *Together*. 

#### Page 16
<!-- Image: Liska, thinking expression, though bubble, paw pile in them -->
A tiny spark of an idea began to glow. 

She remembered their family paw pile... How they'd stack all their paws and laugh.

Liska marched back into the room.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

#### Page 17
<!-- Image: Liska stands between parents, braid held up in one paw. Other points at it. She declares. -->
She planted her feet between her parents and held up the braid. "LOOK!" she declared. "It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me!"

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback
#### Page 18
<!-- Image: Parents look each other in the eye? Liska frozen with expectant/anxious expression? -->
Her parents just stared. The room went so quiet Liska could hear her own heartbeat, a fast, strong thumping in her chest.

<!-- a bit slow and lame -->
That prickly, sad feeling started to creep back into her chest. 

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested -> Learned Skill -> Persistence
#### Page 19
<!-- Image: Liska pulling Papa's paw with effort toward mother -->
She took a tiny, shaky breath, and grabbed Papa's paw. She pulled him toward Mama with all her might. 

#### Page 20
<!-- Image: Liska pulled Papa toward Mama. Now she grabbed Mama's paw. Holds both their paws, puts them one on top the other, holding parent's wrists. Parents look each other in the eye -->
Then she grabbed Mama's paw. She joined their paws and placed her own little paw right on top.

#### Page 21
<!-- Image: Liska's paw on top of theirs, she commands with determined expression. Parents look at her. -->
"Paw pile," she commanded, her voice small but stubborn. "Us. Together."

### Beat 4.4: Success
#### Page 22
<!-- Image: Parents kneeling down, both hugging Liska. Mama's face buried into Liska's top of the head. Relief and joy on Liska's face -->
Something in parents' eyes melted. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug.

"We're so sorry we worried you," Mama whispered into her fur.

Liska let out a huge, happy sigh, melting into their hug.

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief
#### Page 23
<!-- Image: their faces together in a triple kiss -->
They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss—all three noses touching in the middle. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning
#### Page 24
<!-- Image: Sunny corner, they lie together as a sandwich, paws in a paw pile -->
They sat together in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring family sandwich. 

<!-- proud little puff can probably be improved -->
#### Page 25
<!-- Image: idk what facial expression Liska has, but should be something thoughtful. Papa nuzzles her ear. They are sitting up to differ from the previous scene? -->

She looked at their paws, still stacked together.

"I made us remember," she said quietly, a proud little puff in her chest.

Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most."

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo
#### Page 26
<!--  -->
Later, from her sunny corner, Liska watched her parents talking softly.

#### Page 27

<!-- Can be shortened and merged into one scene -->
"I'm sorry I was so sharp," said Papa.

"And I'm sorry I went so quiet," Mama's voice replied, warm as honey.

She saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. As he set it down, he touched Mama's shoulder, and Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes.


### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
#### Page 28
Her treasure-braid swung at her side as she played. Stone, fur, clay. Her family. And her, brave enough to bring them all together.
