## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere

#### Page 1
<!-- Image: Liska sits down in the sunny corner. Engaged, positive, concentrated expression. Blep on her face. Weaving the braid. Small treasures on it.  -->

<!-- where the air smelled like warm earth and honeybees buzzed over clover – that reads too complex and boring. I agree that some sensory things are probably good, but the specific implementation is weak. -->
In a sunny corner of the garden, where the air smelled like warm earth and honeybees buzzed over clover, Liska sat with her treasures. 

She worked with great care, her little brow furrowed in concentration as she finished a small, thick braid. 


#### Page 2
<!-- Image: Close up of the braid with treasures -->
Woven into it was a rainbow 'courage stone' from Papa, a tuft of her own snow-white baby-fur saved by Mama, and a tiny clay tablet with her very first paw-print. Her first mark on the world.

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Braid done. Family treasures all together. Tying like a belt is not necessary. She's proud and happy. Really wants to show her parents.
 -->

#### Page 3
<!-- Image: holds up the finished braids up, happy face -->
She held the braid up to the light, then said to the treasures, "There. Now you're all together."

#### Page 4
<!-- Image: Liska facing door back into the house, clutching the braid to her chest, expectant expression. -->

<!-- Here it feels like it was already done. Because she worked on the braid in page 1, then on page 2 the treasures were already woven into it, then on page 3 she held it up, so I assume it's finished, and on page 4 we are now stating that it's done. And she hugs it, so it's kind of extraneous or something. Maybe something more interesting needs to happen here. -->
Her treasure-braid was finally done. Liska hugged it tight and bounced on her paws, her tail wiggling. She had to show Papa and Mama RIGHT NOW!

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst
<!-- What's important in the beat:
Parents tense, tense pre-conflict atmosphere
 -->

#### Page 5
<!-- Image: Liska in the doorway, stopped, wide eyes, unpleasant surprise. Father and mother stiff -->
She bounded into the main room and skidded to a stop. 

Papa stood by the window, his tail as stiff as a stick. Mama sat far away, her face turned to the wall. The room was so quiet, Liska could hear a bee buzzing outside the window.

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident

#### Page 6
<!-- Image: Liska miffed, ears a bit down. More confused than sad. -->
Her ears drooped. The happy wiggle in her tail stopped.

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)

#### Page 7
<!-- Image: Liska and Papa. She holds out her braid hesitantly. Papa doesn't pay attention -->
She padded over to Papa and held up her braid. "Papa, look what I made."

He glanced down. "That's nice, sweetie." His eyes were already looking back out the window. Liska flinched, as if pricked by a thorn.

#### Page 8
<!-- Image: Liska stands in front of father. Determined expression. Holds the braid up to his face. Talks to him.  -->
She stepped right in front of him, blocking his view and lifting the braid higher. "No, Papa, *look*," she insisted, her voice trembling. "It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us."

#### Page 9
<!-- Image: Papa holds her paw with two paws, lookes her in the eyes, frowns, says not right now  -->

<!-- stormy is probably not an understandable metaphor for 4-5yo -->
Papa looked at her but his gaze was stormy. He put a paw gently over hers. "Liska, sweetie, not right now." 

#### Page 10
<!-- Image: father holds her by the shoulders, turning her away, slightly pushing her back-->
His paw pushed hers softly away. 

<!-- That does not flow very well from the previous phrase. So the scene should be, yeah, that he's pushing her away, but the transition to her fleeing down the hallway should be done better. -->
Liska's breath caught in her throat.

### Beat 3.2: Low Point

#### Page 11
<!-- Image: -->
She fled to the hallway. She sank to the floor and wrapped her arms around her knees, making herself as small as possible. The treasure-braid felt heavy and useless in her lap.

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

<!-- That needs a rewrite. So he comes in, sits with her, hugs her, labels the emotion, names it. That's like, yeah, you're very sad, then validates it, like I would be sad too, or, yeah, that's good. Then he explains. We keep the, it's not your fault, little one, we love you. Then we need to condense. the rest. So he helps her sit up, asks her something very short, like, hold your breath, can you take a slow breath for me? Then he asks her, like, can you do that for me while we finish talking? She nods. He squeezes her last time and goes back to the room.  -->

#### Page 12
<!-- a bit sudden, no lead in to him comivng over. Not saying anything is kinda lame. Can be shortened. Weak page. -->
Papa's warm shadow fell over her. He sat on the floor and rested a heavy, warm paw on her back, saying nothing. He just sat with her, breathing slowly, until her big sobs turned into little hiccups.

#### Page 13
<!-- Image: -->

"I see you are very sad," he said softly. "Mama and I... we are arguing. But it is not your fault, little one, we love you." He squeezed her gently. "Can you take one of your slow, deep breaths for me while Mama and I finish talking?" Liska nodded. "Thank you." Papa said. He helped her sit up, hugged her one last time, and returned to the other room.

### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation
#### Page 14
<!-- Image: Liska still sad, looks at the braid on the floor, touches it -->

Liska's hiccups slowly quieted. For a long moment, she just sat there, tracing the treasures on her braid with one paw. The stone felt solid, like Papa. The fur felt soft, like Mama. And the clay reminded her that her own paws could make things.

#### Page 15
<!-- Image: Liska, thinking expression, thought bubble, paw pile in them -->
She remembered their family paw pile... how they'd stack all their paws together and laugh. 

<!-- Here we are counting Papa / Mama / Her, Stone / Fur / Clay, we repeat that too many times over the tale. We need to consider how to improve on that repetition -->
Papa's big warm paw, Mama's soft one, and hers right on top. 

A tiny spark of an idea began to glow.

#### Page 16
<!-- Image: Liska's expression changes from thoughtful to determined. She gets up. -->

<!-- Maybe yes, but a bit lame. I don't feel any engagement from this page. -->
The spark grew into a warm, steady light inside her. Yes. That was it. Liska scrambled to her paws and marched back into the room.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt

#### Page 17
<!-- Image: Liska stands between parents, braid held up in one paw. Other points at it. She declares. -->

<!-- We already had planted her feet? -->
She planted her feet between her parents and held up the braid. "LOOK!" she declared. "It's us! The stone is Papa! The tuft is Mama! And the paw print is me! All together! Look!"

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback
#### Page 18
<!-- Image: Parents look each other in the eye? Liska frozen with expectant/anxious expression? -->
Her parents just stared. 

<!-- We already did "the room was so quiet -->
The room went so quiet Liska could hear her own heartbeat. 

<!-- This is good -->
For a scary second, nothing happened.

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested -> Learned Skill -> Persistence
#### Page 19
<!-- Image: Liska pulling Papa's paw with effort toward mother -->
Then, she took a tiny, shaky breath, and grabbed Papa's paw. She grunted and pulled him toward Mama with all her might. 

#### Page 20
<!-- Image: Liska pulled Papa toward Mama. Now she grabbed Mama's paw. Holds both their paws, puts them one on top the other, holding parent's wrists. Parents look each other in the eye -->
Then she grabbed Mama's paw. She joined their paws and placed her own little paw right on top.

#### Page 21
<!-- Image: Liska's paw on top of theirs, she commands with determined expression. Parents look at her. -->
"Paw pile," she commanded, her voice small but stubborn. "Us. Together."

### Beat 4.4: Success
#### Page 22
<!-- Image: Parents kneeling down, both hugging Liska. Mama's face buried into Liska's top of the head. Relief and joy on Liska's face -->
Something in parents' eyes melted. In a rush of warm fur, they both knelt and pulled her into a tight, safe hug.

"We're so sorry we worried you," Mama whispered into her fur.

### Beat 4.5: Reward -> Relief
#### Page 23
<!-- Image: their faces together in a triple kiss -->

<!-- A bit abrupt, needs lead-in line -->
They sealed their hug with their special Triple Kiss—all three noses touching in the middle. Warm breath, soft whiskers, and the feeling of everything being right again.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning
#### Page 24
<!-- Image: Sunny corner, they lie together as a sandwich, paws in a paw pile -->
Later they sat together in a heap in the sunny corner, Liska the warm filling in a purring family sandwich. 

#### Page 25
<!-- Image: idk what facial expression Liska has, but should be something thoughtful. Papa nuzzles her ear. They are sitting up to differ from the previous scene? -->

<!-- Sat together on page 24. Tacked together here. Repeating "together" too much. -->
She looked at their paws, still stacked together.

"I made us remember," she said quietly, and a little purr rumbled in her throat.

Papa nuzzled her ear. "Yes, little one. You helped us remember what matters most."

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo
#### Page 26
<!-- Image: Liska in the sunny corner of the garder. Looks at father and mother talking. -->

<!-- We already did later sunny corner -->
Later, from her sunny corner, Liska watched her parents talking softly.

<!-- sharp / quiet / warm as honey are all lame choices of words -->
"I'm sorry I was so sharp," said Papa.

"And I'm sorry I went so quiet," Mama's voice replied, warm as honey.

#### Page 27
<!-- Image: Mother sits on the cushions near the pond. Father brings her a cup, touches her shoulder, they look each other in the eyes, happy -->
She saw Papa bring Mama her favorite tea. As he set it down, he touched Mama's shoulder, and Mama looked up with crinkly, happy eyes.


### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought
#### Page 28
<!-- Image: Liska touching the braid on her waist, looking at it, content expression -->

<!-- Abrupt, we never said she's playing. Needs lead-in.  -->
Liska's treasure-braid swung at her side as she played. Stone, fur, clay. Her family. And her, brave enough to bring them all together.
