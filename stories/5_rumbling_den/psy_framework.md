# Psychological Framework: "Rumbling Den"

**Child's Age:** 4-5 years old
**The Setting:** Family home - sunny corner in back garden, main room
**The Situation:** Witnessing parents in tense conflict, feeling disconnected from secure family base
**Target Emotion:** Sadness from family disconnection

---

## Framework 1: Psychological Analysis (The "Why")

**Core Emotion:** **Sadness** - The child experiences profound sadness when the secure family base feels threatened by parental conflict. This sadness stems from the sudden disruption of emotional safety and the fear that the family bond might be breaking.

**Primary Drivers:**
- **Attachment Disruption:** Young children depend on parents as their secure base. When parents are emotionally unavailable due to conflict, the child's attachment system activates distress signals, manifesting as deep sadness and need for reconnection.
- **Emotional Contagion:** Children this age are highly sensitive to parental emotional states. The "cold" tension between parents directly transfers to the child's emotional experience, creating a heavy, sad feeling they cannot fully understand.
- **Helplessness:** Lacking the cognitive tools to understand adult conflict, the child feels powerless to fix what feels broken, intensifying the sadness into overwhelming grief.

**Secondary Drivers:**
- **Egocentric Thinking:** At 4-5, children often believe they might be the cause of problems, adding guilt to their sadness
- **Concrete Thinking:** Abstract concepts like "disagreement" don't compute - they only see "not together" which equals "broken"
- **Limited Emotional Vocabulary:** Cannot articulate complex feelings, experiencing them as physical sensations and behavioral impulses

## Framework 2: The Child's Subjective Experience (The "What")

**Immediate Response (First Seconds):**
- "Something's wrong!"
<!-- - "The air feels bad" -->
- "Why won't they look at me?"
- "My purr-box is broken" / Моя мурчалка сломалась
- "Need to fix it NOW!"

**Primary Feelings (What Overwhelms Them):**
- "Big hurt in my chest"
- "Everything feels broken"
- "They don't see me!"
- "Want to disappear"
- "Too heavy to stand"

**Physical Sensations (How Their Body Feels):**
<!-- - "Tummy feels like falling" -->
- "Can't make my smile work"
- "Chest squeezy-tight"
- "Eyes getting hot and wet"
- "Feel very very small"

**Secondary Reactions (After Initial Response):**
- "Did I do something bad?"
- "Are they mad at ME?"
<!-- - "Want my old family back!" -->
- "Maybe if I'm really good..."
- "Need them to be together!"

**What They Notice (Environmental Awareness):**
- "Papa's tail all stiff"
- "Mama looking at wall, not me"
- "No warm feeling anymore"
- "They're too far apart"
<!-- - "The happy place feels cold" -->

**Summary:** "The progression moves from sensing wrongness and emotional disconnection, through overwhelming sadness and physical distress, to desperate attempts to restore the family bond through concrete action."

## Framework 3: Narrative Implementation (The "How")

**Environmental Description Setup:**
<!-- - *The sunbeam looked tired, like it had stayed up all night and couldn't be bothered to be yellow anymore.* -->
- *The space between Mama and Papa had become 'No-Cubs-Land', guarded by invisible grumpy monsters.*
<!-- - *Her sunny corner, usually the best place for a nap, now felt like a bed made of grumpy hedgehogs.* -->
- *The air that usually smelled like cinnamon and safety now felt sharp and wrong*
<!-- - *Even the familiar walls seemed to lean away from each other* -->

**Character's Physical Experience:**
- *Liska's happy wiggle died like a flame going out, her tail dropping to the floor*
- *Her chest felt squeezy-tight, like someone was sitting on it*
- *She curled into the tiniest ball, trying to hold all her pieces together*
- *Big gulpy sobs came from deep in her belly, shaking her whole small body*
- *Her paws pressed hard against her treasure-braid, holding it like it might fly away*

**Character's Thoughts/Words (Age-Appropriate):**
- *"No, Papa, LOOK! It's you, and Mama, and me. It's us!"*
- *"I made us remember"*
- *"Together. Us. Together!"*
- *"Why won't they see? It's RIGHT HERE!"*
- *"The braid is us... why can't they feel it?"*

**Showing Internal State Through Action:**
- *She planted herself between them like a tiny, determined mountain*
- *Her small paws grabbed theirs with surprising strength, pulling them together*
- *She pressed down on their stacked paws, as if she could glue them there forever*
- *Liska ran to the hallway and collapsed, making herself as small as her hurt*
- *She clutched the braid against her chest, each treasure a piece of the family she needed back*

**Sensory Vocabulary (Prioritized for this emotion):**
- Primary words: heavy, cold, squeezey, gulpy, droop, tremble, tight
- Supporting words: dim, sharp, stiff, distant, quiet, small, shaky

**Key Narrative Techniques:**
1. **Physical Metaphors for Emotional Distance:** Use spatial separation and temperature changes to show emotional disconnection
2. **Body-Based Sadness Descriptions:** Ground the emotion in physical sensations a child would recognize
3. **Contrast Technique:** Juxtapose the "before" warmth with "during conflict" coldness to heighten the sadness
4. **Size Imagery:** Use "small/big" contrasts to show how sadness makes the child feel diminished
5. **Progression Pattern:** Move from environmental wrongness → physical collapse → co-regulation → brave action → restoration
