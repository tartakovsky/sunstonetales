---

## Act 1: Introduction – Normal Life

### Beat 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere
Liska bounced around her room, singing her new camp song. "Swimming, climbing, friends all day! Camp explorers love to play!" 
In between verses, she would run to her favorite sleeping rug, jump and roll on it. It smelled just like home. Then she'd jump up and sing some more.

### Beat 1.2: Introduce character(s)
Mara tucked her in, smoothing the soft fur between Liska's ears. "Sleep well, my little explorer. Tomorrow is your big day."
Liska wiggled under her blanket. "I'm going to climb the tallest tree! And swim to the middle of the lake! And-" she yawned mid-sentence, her tail giving one last excited flick.
"And right now you're going to close those sleepy eyes," Mara said gently, giving her the special goodnight scratch behind the ears.
Liska fell asleep dreaming of splashing and climbing and all the fun waiting for her.

## Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
Morning came quickly. Time to pack! Liska's overnight bag sat open on the floor.

She bounced up and put in her swimming clothes. Then she took her favorite toy, a soft little sloth. She held it to her chest for a moment. Her shoulders drooped just a tiny bit. She slowly put the sloth in the bag. Then, just as slowly, took it out again. Her tail, which had been swishing with excitement, was now still.

She stared at the bag. Tonight she wouldn't be here. Tonight mama wouldn't be with her. The excited bouncing from yesterday felt very far away.

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

Mara entered and saw Liska sitting very still, clutching her sloth, her little shoulders hunched. She stared at the half-packed bag.
She sat down beside her daughter. "What is it, kitten?"
Liska's body went stiff. Her voice came out tiny and wobbly: "The 'overnight' part... does that mean... sleeping there? All night? Without you?"


### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
For a moment, Liska froze completely still, her eyes wide as moons. Then her face crumpled. "I don't want to go without you!" She threw herself into her mother's arms, her whole little body shaking.

### Beat 2.4: Fallout
Liska's shoulders shook with big, gulping sobs. Her paws clutched at her mother's fur. "I want you to come with me!" she cried between breaths.

Mara wrapped her arms around her daughter, holding her tight and steady. She rocked slowly, staying quiet and calm, letting Liska cry. "I'm right here, kitten," she murmured. "I'm right here."

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve

### Beat 3.1: Recovery
Mara kept rocking until the biggest sobs turned into smaller sniffles. Finally, Liska's breathing started to slow down, though her paws still gripped tight.
"That big lonely feeling hurts so much doesn't it?" Mara said softly. "It's okay to feel scared about being away from someone you love."

Liska nodded against Mara's fur, then pulled back slightly to look at her mother's face.

"I have something special that might help," Mara said. "Would you like to see?" Liska gave a tiny nod. Mara opened her special drawer and brought out a small tuft of white fur on a string.

"Do you know what this is?" Mara asked gently.

Liska shook her head.

"This is a piece of your very own baby fur," Mara said, her voice warm with memory. "I saved it from when you were tiny because the day you were born was the happiest day of my life. Feel how soft it is."

Liska touched it with one paw. It was the softest thing she'd ever felt. It felt familiar.

"This tuft can hold all my love," Mara continued. "I think it might help you when that big lonely feeling comes. Want to try?"

<!-- 

Liska looked up, listening.

"First, hold the tuft and whisper, 'Mama loves me.' That's our secret signal. It will send my love right to your heart."

"Second, I want you to find the moon. No matter where we are, we can both see the same moon. When you see it, know that I am looking at it too, and I'm sending my goodnight wave right to you." -->

### Beat 3.2: Attempt 1 (Initial Reaction / Less Considered Approach)

"First," Mara said, tying the tuft gently around Liska's neck, "when you feel lonely, hold this tuft tight. Then whisper our special words: 'Mama loves me.' Let's practice together."
Liska held the tuft. "Mama loves me," she whispered.
"How did that feel?" Mara asked.
"Still sad," Liska said honestly.
"That's okay. It only needs to help a little. And there's a second part." Mara pointed to the window. "See the moon last night?"
Liska nodded.
"No matter where you are, we can both see the same moon. So when you're lonely, after you hold your tuft, look at the moon. I'll be looking at it too, sending you my love."
<!-- instead of that they should just wave at the moon together as usual and then mom can say "wave at the moon when you see it, I'll be waving right back to you. -->
"But what if I can't see it?" Liska's voice got worried again.
"Then you imagine it," Mara said. "Let's practice that too. Close your eyes."
Liska closed her eyes. Mara guided her: "Picture the big, round moon. Now wave to it. I'm waving too."
Liska gave a tiny wave, then opened her eyes. "I still don't want to go," she said, but her voice was steadier.
<!-- No brave and scared anywhere, we're dealing with loneliness and anxiety, not fear -->
<!--  -->

She stands up and grabs her bag. Her legs feel shaky. She takes two steps, but her body turns back all by itself and she runs to hug her mother's leg.
Mara kneels down. "We can be sad and still walk." 
Together, holding paws, they walk to the door. This time, Liska's other paw is clutching the tuft.

 -->

### Beat 3.3: Attempt 2
At camp, Liska had fun! She really did. She splashed in the lake with other cubs and sang silly songs. She won a snail race and ate two whole kebabs for dinner.

But as the sun painted the sky orange and pink, a counselor started the goodnight song: 
"When the day is done, and the stars come out,
We think of home, and the ones we love...

The words hit Liska like cold water. Her chest got tight. Her tummy felt hollow. That big lonely feeling crashed over her like a wave.

### Beat 3.4: Low Point
Bedtime. The tent smelled wrong - like other cubs and strange blankets. Her camp blanket was scratchy, not soft like home. The pillow was flat. No gentle scratch behind her ears. No papa telling bedtime stories about brave little animals. No goodnight wave to the moon together.

Her throat felt hot and tight. Tears started rolling down her face. She tried to be quiet but little whimpers escaped. She pulled the scratchy blanket over her head and curled into the tightest, saddest ball she could make.

"Mama," she whispered into her flat pillow. "I want my mama."

### Beat 3.5: Recovery

Her paw, wet with tears, brushed against something at her neck. Something soft.

The tuft.

She grabbed it and squeezed tight. Through her tears, she could barely remember what Mama said. What were the words? She squeezed harder, trying to think through the lonely fog in her head.

"Mama..." she started, then remembered. "Mama loves me." The words came out shaky and full of tears. 

The big lonely feeling was still there, heavy in her chest. But... but saying the words made her remember Mama's face. Mama's warm paws. Mama's soft voice. 

"Mama loves me," she whispered again, still crying but breathing a tiny bit better. "Mama loves me. I will see her tomorrow." She kept squeezing the tuft, feeling how soft it was, just like Mama's fur.


### Beat 3.6: Re-evaluation

**Narrative Text:**
The crying had made her so tired. She lay there, still curled up but not quite so tight anymore, just holding the tuft.
Through a small gap in the tent flap, she saw something bright.
The moon. 

She and mama always said goodnight to the moon. Every single night, Mama would hold her up to the window and they'd wave.
A tiny, simple thought came to her: The moon... Mama said... look for the moon! She can see the moon, too. It's the same moon.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution

### Beat 4.1: Final Attempt / Approach

**Narrative Text:**
Very slowly, like a snail from the race, Liska uncurled from her ball. Everything felt heavy and tired from crying. Her legs wobbled as she sat up.

She clutched her tuft in one paw and grabbed her camp blanket with the other. Inch by inch, she crept toward the tent flap.

### Beat 4.2: Rising Tension / Suspense

**Narrative Text:**
She reached for the tent flap, then froze. Outside was dark. Outside was unknown. The lonely feeling rushed up again, trying to push her back to her sleeping bag.

It would be so much easier to curl up again. To hide until morning. To just cry until she fell asleep.

Her paw holding the tuft started to shake. 

Then she heard it - a tiny sniffle from somewhere outside. Someone else was crying too.

> **Suggestions:**
> - **Psychology:** Internal conflict between safety and connection
> - **Pacing:** Pause at the threshold builds suspense
> - **Engagement:** Another crying child creates immediate hook
> - **Character:** Physical manifestation of fear (shaking paw)

### Beat 4.3: Turning Point / Final Push

**Narrative Text:**
Liska squeezed her tuft so very tight. "Mama loves me," she whispered fiercely. "Mama loves. I will see her soon."

With her heart thumping like a rabbit's, she pushed open the tent flap.


### Beat 4.4: Success
There it was. The big, bright moon, hanging in the sky just like at home.

She sat down right outside the tent, wrapping the blanket around her shoulders. She held up her tuft toward it and waved. "Hi mama," she whispered. "I see the moon. Do you see it too?" A tiny smile touched her wet face.

### Beat 4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief
"I see it."

Another cub sat nearby, also wrapped in a blanket, also looking up with a tear-streaked face.

"I miss my mama," the cub said quietly.

"Me too," Liska said, her voice wobbly. And suddenly, she didn't feel quite so alone. "Want to sit with me?"

## Act 5: Resolution

### Beat 5.1: Catharsis
They sat together, two small, blanket-wrapped shapes under the big moon. The other cub pointed with his nose. "My papa showed me the star that never moves."

Liska looked up. The giant lonely feeling in her chest was getting smaller and smaller, making room for something else. "My papa shows me stars, too."

<!-- 
> i liked that "normalizing crying" sequence.

"I cried a lot."

"Me too," the cub said. "Grandma says crying is just feelings leaking out when there's too many inside."

Liska thought about that. She had a lot of feelings inside. "Want to sit together until we feel better?"

"Yes," the cub said, scooting closer. "And tomorrow, want to build a secret fort? I saw the perfect mossy sticks by the creek."

"Yes!" For the first time all evening, Liska felt a tiny bubble of excitement mix with the sadness. -->

"Want to build a secret fort tomorrow?" the cub asked. "I know where the best mossy sticks are."

"Yes!" For the first time since the sun went down, Liska felt a tiny bubble of excitement.

### Beat 5.2: Reflection & Learning
The next morning, Liska woke up feeling surprised. She had made it through the whole night.

At breakfast, when another camper said, "I cried last night," Liska hugged her sloth and said, "Me too. My tuft helped." She touched it under her chin, her own special secret.

The cub from yesterday smiled at her from across the table. They had a fort to build.

### Beat 5.3: Integration
The next evening, Liska ran into her mother's arms, burying her face in her fur. "MAMA! I missed you SO SO SO MUCH!" she said. "And I cried! But I held my tuft! You love me! And I saw the moon! And I made a friend!"

<!-- which hard things specifically. Remember the rule that the praise needs to be process and specific. -->
Mara held her tight, rocking her. "You felt sad AND you did 
hard things. I'm so proud of you."
Needs:
> - **Psychology:** Specific process praise for using tools while distressed
> - **Developmental:** Acknowledges helping others while struggling


### Beat 5.4: New Status Quo / Harmonious Scene
That night, safe in her own bed with her soft quilt and right-smelling pillow, Liska carefully placed the tuft on her special shelf next to a mossy stick from her fort with Finn.

"Mama?" she said as Mara gave her the bedtime scratch.
"Yes, kitten?"
She snuggled under her heavy quilt and smiled. "Camp was fun."

### Beat 5.5: Concluding Thought / Wrap-up
As sleep pulled her under like a warm wave, Liska touched her tuft one more time. The big lonely feeling will come back. But now she knew: she could hold Mama's love with her, even when Mama wasn't there. And sometimes, when you're brave enough to look for the moon, you find a friend looking too.
