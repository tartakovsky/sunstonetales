## Act 1: Introduction

### Beat 1.1: Introduce Characters, Setting and Atmosphere
Liska bounced around her room, singing her new camp song. "Swimming, climbing, friends all day! Camp explorers love to play!" 
In between verses, she would run to her favorite sleeping rug, jump and roll on it. It smelled just like home. Then she'd jump up and sing some more.

Mara tucked her in, smoothing the soft fur between Liska's ears. "Sleep well, my little explorer. Tomorrow is your big day."
Liska wiggled under her blanket. "I'm going to climb the tallest tree! And swim to the middle of the lake! And-" she yawned mid-sentence, her tail giving one last excited flick.
"And right now you're going to close those sleepy eyes," Mara said gently, giving her the special goodnight scratch behind the ears.
Liska fell asleep dreaming of splashing and climbing and all the fun waiting for her.

## Act 2: The Challenge Begins

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up
Morning came quickly. Time to pack! Liska's overnight bag sat open on the floor.

She bounced up and put in her swimming clothes. Then she took her favorite toy, a soft little sloth. She held it to her chest for a moment. Her shoulders drooped just a tiny bit. She slowly put the sloth in the bag. Then, just as slowly, took it out again. Her tail, which had been swishing with excitement, was now still.

She stared at the bag. Tonight she wouldn't be here. Tonight mama wouldn't be with her. The excited bouncing from yesterday felt very far away.

### Beat 2.2: The Catalyst

Mara entered and saw Liska sitting very still, clutching her sloth, her little shoulders hunched. She stared at the half-packed bag.
She sat down beside her daughter. "What is it, kitten?"
Liska's body went stiff. Her voice came out tiny and wobbly: "The 'overnight' part... does that mean... sleeping there? All night? Without you?"

### Beat 2.3: The Core Incident
<!-- 

A bit weak and disconnected from the previous beat, but yeah 

also that's more of a fallout than incident. We don't need that much fallout and don't need co-regulation yet. Mother shows support and understanding, Liska goes directly to unskilled attempts. 
-->
Liska's eyes went wide as moons. Her bottom lip stuck out. "But... but I don't want to sleep without you," she said, her voice getting smaller with each word. She pressed the sloth tight against her chest and her shoulders hunched up to her ears.

"That's a big feeling, isn't it?" Mara said gently, pulling Liska into a quick hug. "Missing someone we love is hard."

## Act 3: Attempts to Solve - Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

### Beat 3.1: Unskilled Attempt(s)

Liska pulled back from the hug, wiping her nose with the back of her paw. "Maybe... maybe I could just go for the day part? And come home for sleeping?"

"Camp is too far away for that, kitten," Mara said softly.

Liska thought hard, her tail twitching. "What if I take ALL my stuffed animals? Then it would be like home!" She jumped up and started grabbing toys from her shelf - her sloth, three bears, a floppy rabbit, and her special cushion.

The bag wouldn't close. Toys kept falling out. "They don't fit!" Liska's voice rose in frustration. She tried sitting on the bag, bouncing up and down. A bear popped out one side. The rabbit escaped from the other.

"It's not working!" She threw the sloth down. "Nothing works! I can't make it like home!"

### Beat 3.2: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)
<!-- it's enough to state she wants mom two times, three is too much -->
Liska's face crumpled. She dropped to the floor next to the scattered toys, curling into herself. "I don't want to go anymore," she cried, her shoulders shaking. "I just want to stay here with you."

Big tears rolled down her fuzzy cheeks. She grabbed her tail and held it tight, rocking back and forth. "Why does camp have to be overnight? Why can't you come with me?"

The excitement from yesterday was completely gone. All that was left was a heavy, lonely feeling in her chest.

### Beat 3.3: Recovery

Mara sat down on the floor beside Liska, gently pulling her into her lap. She rocked slowly, letting Liska cry into her fur. "I know, kitten. I know it hurts."

When the biggest sobs turned to sniffles, Mara wiped Liska's tears with her paw. "That lonely feeling is so big, isn't it?"

Liska nodded, hiccupping.

"It's okay to feel scared about being away from someone you love," Mara said softly, still rocking.

### Beat 3.4: Re-evaluation
<!-- what's important in the beat

tuft intro exactly as is

needs more agency from Liska

practice might be simplified

 -->
 

"I have something special that might help," Mara said. "Would you like to see?" 

Liska gave a tiny nod. Mara opened her special drawer and brought out a small tuft of white fur on a string.

"Do you know what this is?" Mara asked gently.

Liska shook her head.

"This is a piece of your very own baby fur," Mara said, her voice warm with memory. "I saved it from when you were tiny because the day you were born was the happiest day of my life. Feel how soft it is."

Liska touched it with one paw. It was the softest thing she'd ever felt. It felt familiar.

"This tuft can hold all my love," Mara continued. "I think it might help you when that big lonely feeling comes. Want to try?"

"First," Mara said, tying the tuft gently around Liska's neck, "when you feel lonely, hold this tuft tight. Then whisper our special words: 'Mama loves me.' Let's practice together."

Liska held the tuft. "Mama loves me," she whispered.

"How did that feel?" Mara asked.

"Still sad," Liska said honestly.

<!-- Still sad / help a little must be kept -->
"That's okay. It only needs to help a little. And there's a second part." Mara pointed to the window. "Remember how we always wave at the moon at bedtime?"

Liska nodded.

"No matter where you are, we can both see the same moon. So when you're lonely at camp, after you hold your tuft, look for the moon and wave. I'll be waving right back to you."

Liska closed her eyes. Mara guided her: "Picture the big, round moon. Now wave to it. I'm waving too."

Liska gave a tiny wave, then opened her eyes. "I still don't want to go," she said, but her voice was steadier.

Liska stood up slowly, still holding the tuft. Maybe she could try camp. Just try.

## Act 4: Climax & Solution - Overcoming Externally & Internally

### Beat 4.1: Skilled Attempt
<!-- general idea is right, needs significant rewrite to be punchy, engaging, fun. That's the part where the child should laugh histerically, be maximally engaged and relate the most -->
At camp, Liska threw herself into every activity. During swimming, when a pang of homesickness hit, she touched the tuft under her camp shirt. "Mama loves me," she whispered to herself, then dove back in.

At lunch, when everyone talked about their families, she held it again. The lonely feeling got smaller each time, just like Mama said.

By afternoon, she was laughing with new friends, the tuft bouncing against her chest as she ran. She was doing it! She was being a camp explorer!

But as the sun painted the sky orange and pink, the counselor started the goodnight song:
"When the day is done, and the stars come out,
We think of home, and the ones we love..."

The words hit Liska like cold water. Her chest got tight. Her tummy felt hollow.

### Beat 4.2: Minor Setback
<!-- here we need to consider whether it needs to be that heavy. Draw a curve of emotion valence over text. What kind of curve is okay for 4-5yo? -->
Bedtime. The tent smelled wrong - like other cubs and strange blankets. The blanket was scratchy, not soft like home. The pillow was flat. No bedtime stories. No goodnight scratch behind the ears. No mama.

The lonely feeling didn't creep up this time - it crashed over her like a huge wave. Bigger than this morning. Bigger than anything. Because now it was real. She was really, truly alone in the dark.

<!-- So yeah as written above we have an issue here that the story first had a fallout and a low point with two recoveries but now it doesn't anymore so we put the low point into the moment where she's still home. But then the actual low point, it seems, would happen when she's actually at the camp. When the long list actually hits. It needs a proper brainstorm and redesign of what would actually happen to a child. would they dysregulate more from anticipation of loneliness or from actual loneliness? Then we'll need to think whether that fits into the structure because right now the whole all tapped thing is kind of a response to a dysregulation. But if you don't have a dysregulation, there is not a strong reason to like for that much of teaching. So basically, the story does not fit right now into the structure that well. And we need to figure out what to do about it. -->
Tears rolled down her face as she curled into a tight ball. "I want my mama," she whimpered into the flat pillow.

### Beat 4.3: Resolve Tested → Learned Skill → Persistence

Through her tears, Liska's paw found the tuft. She clutched it so tight her paw hurt. 

"M-mama loves me," she gasped between sobs. The words barely made it out. "Mama l-loves me."

She kept saying it, over and over, still crying but trying so hard. The tuft felt soft between her paws, just like Mama said. Then through the tent flap, she saw it - the moon, bright and round.

With every bit of strength she had left, Liska sat up. She had to see it better. She had to wave. Even though everything in her wanted to stay curled up and cry.

### Beat 4.4: Success

She pushed through the tent flap and sat outside, tears still on her cheeks but breathing steadier now. There it was - their moon.

Liska held up her tuft and waved with her whole arm, just like at bedtime. "Hi Mama," she whispered. "I see the moon. Are you waving too?"

The lonely feeling was still there, but now it had to share space with something else. Connection. Love. The bridge Mama talked about.

### Beat 4.5: Reward → Relief

"I see it too."

Another cub sat nearby, also wrapped in a blanket, also with wet cheeks. 

"I miss my mama," the cub said quietly.

"Me too," Liska said, and suddenly she wasn't alone in her sadness. The huge lonely feeling loosened its grip. "Want to sit with me?"

They sat together under the stars, two small cubs who missed home but found each other. The night didn't feel quite so big and scary anymore.

"Want to build a secret fort tomorrow?" the cub asked. "I know where the best mossy sticks are."

"Yes!" For the first time since the sun went down, Liska felt a tiny bubble of excitement mix with the sadness.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion - Integrating the Growth

### Beat 5.1: Reflection & Learning

The next morning, Liska woke up with crusty eyes from crying but also... proud. She had made it through the hardest night.

At breakfast, when another camper said, "I cried last night," 
Liska hugged her sloth and said, "Me too. My tuft helped." She 
touched it under her chin, her own special secret.

The cub from yesterday smiled at her from across the table. They 
had a fort to build.

### Beat 5.2: Making it Right / Integration / New Status Quo

The next evening, Liska ran into her mother's arms, burying her 
face in her fur. "MAMA! I missed you SO SO SO MUCH!" she said. 
"And I cried! But I held my tuft! You love me! And I saw the moon! 
And I made a friend!"

Mara held her tight. "You kept using your tools even when the feeling was huge. That's really hard to do. I'm so proud of how you took care of yourself."

That night, safe in her own bed with her soft quilt and 
right-smelling pillow, Liska carefully placed the tuft on her 
special shelf next to a mossy stick from her fort with the cub.

"Mama?" she said as Mara gave her the bedtime scratch.
"Yes, kitten?"
"Camp was fun AND hard. But I did it."

### Beat 5.3: Concluding Thought

As sleep pulled her under like a warm wave, Liska touched her tuft one more time. The big lonely feeling will come back. But now she knew: she could hold Mama's love with her, even when Mama wasn't there. And sometimes, when you're brave enough to look for the moon, you find a friend looking too.
