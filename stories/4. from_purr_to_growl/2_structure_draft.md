Anji bounces in excitedly, yowling with his usual boundless energy, his cream fur with brown points catching the light, and reaches for Liska's paints again without asking, his cape flapping dramatically as he leans over her new drawing with eager paws.

### 4.2: Rising Tension / Suspense
- Slot: `Engagement`: Tension (Liska feeling signals again).
- Event: Liska feels familiar emotional signals, her face heating up with indignation as the familiar burn creeps into her cheeks, and notices them with 'Spot,' thinking to herself, 'There's that wildfire again.'

She presses her paws hard together in front of her chest with a funny, concentrated face, feeling the squeeze steady her. She tells Anji to ask before taking things with 'Shift,' raising a paw hesitantly but with resolve, her voice a little shaky but clear, 'Stop!' as she looks directly at him, her tail still puffed but her stance firm with newfound determination.

### 4.4: Success (External Problem Resolved)
- Event: Anji blinks in surprise, his blue eyes wide, ears twitching back as he pulls his paw away from the paints. Liska uses 'Shift,' establishing the boundary firmly, 'It's my drawing. You must ask for permission,' her voice steadier now. Shocked by her command, he hesitates, his tail flicking uncertainly, then yowls softly with a sheepish look, 'Can I draw too?' showing a shift in his behavior as he respects her space for the first time.

### 4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief (Accomplishment & Positive Emotion)
- Event: Liska feels tension leave her body, her face cooling down as the burning sensation fades. She nods gently, 'Okay, let's draw.' Anji lets out a happy yip. 'Hooray!' A small smile breaks through on Liska's face, her tail relaxing and swaying slightly, feeling a sense of relief wash over her like a cool breeze, her heart lighter knowing she protected her space successfully.

## Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth
### 5.1: Relaxation / Immediate Aftermath (Processing the Journey)
- Slot (Optional): `Fun`: Nurture Fun (shared drawing).
- Event: Liska and Anji draw together at the small table in the garden, side by side under the morning sun, with Anji being careful for once, pausing to yowl softly for permission before reaching for a crayon.

Add a small interactive element with Anji to make it fun but subtle. For example, 'Liska wiggles with a giggle, thinking how breathing made her feel like a mighty snow leopard, strong and calm. She puffs out her chest playfully, catching Anji's curious glance, and chirps to herself, "I can handle anything now!" her eyes bright with her secret power.' This keeps it short and fun with a hint of connection to the next beat.

### 5.3: Making it Right / Integration (Acknowledging & Embodying Change)
- Slot: `Engagement`: Empathy (building friendship).
- Slot: `Support`: Partnership Language, Success Setup (mutual support through shared activity) (from support_types.csv).
Add a small resolution to the chase for deeper bonding. For example, 'Anji, with a mischievous glint, snatches a stray leaf and darts off, yowling, "Catch me if you can!" Liska laughs with a delighted chirp, chasing him around the garden table, her tail bouncing. They tumble together in a giggling heap after she tags him, rebuilding trust through this lively game, a joyful harmony settling as their conflict melts into shared fun.' This adds a conclusive moment to the play while maintaining the active, fun tone.

### 5.4: New Status Quo / Harmonious Scene (Character Transformed)
- Event: Liska and Anji draw a picture each, working toward two gifts for Liska's mother, their small table covered in colorful strokes under the dawn-lit pergola. They smile at each other, sharing colors to make beautiful art together, tails swaying in sync with a gentle rhythm, their friendship visibly stronger as they create side by side without conflict, a new understanding shining in their cooperative play.

### 5.5: Concluding Thought / Wrap-up
- Event: The garden echoes with their quiet, friendly purring, signaling harmony as they sit close, smiling while their purrs blend in the peaceful morning air. Liska looks at their finished drawings, thinking happily how she learned to calm her wildfire and still keep her friend. She felt proud, and her heart was light with the joy of a mended bond.
