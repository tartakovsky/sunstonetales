---

## **Act 1: Introduction**

### **1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere**

- **Event Text:** Setting: Garden at dawn. Atmosphere: Calm and creative, with the sky turning pink and the air smelling of fresh dew, setting a peaceful morning scene.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The sensory details establish a calm baseline before introducing conflict.
  - **Critique:** The term "dawn" might be too abstract for the target age group, feeling more poetic than child-centric. The scene is also very static.
  - **Suggestion:** In the final prose, use concrete phrasing like "early in the morning." More importantly, add 1-2 short, vivid details to make the scene feel alive without disrupting the calm (e.g., a bee buzzing over a flower, the swish of Liska's tail).

<!-- WRITER: Start with "That morning in the garden..." Add a single sensory surprise that creates immediate "ooh" - perhaps dewdrops that look like tiny diamonds on spiderweb, or a butterfly that thinks Liska's ear is a flower. Keep it 1-2 lines max but make it sparkle with wonder. -->

### **1.2: Introduce character(s)**

- **Event Text:** Liska draws a gift for her mother, purring loudly with joy, her tail swaying happily. She sticks out her tongue in adorable effort, focusing intensely on her art with a small smile, her spotted fur catching the soft dawn light as she hums contentedly over her childlike drawing of her family.

<!-- WRITER: This is overwritten and tells too much. Show ONE endearing action that reveals everything. Maybe: "Liska's pink tongue poked out as she drew. She added extra-big whiskers to Mama's face - the most important part! Her purr rumbled so loud it made the crayons vibrate on the wooden table." This shows concentration, love for mother, and childlike priorities all through action. -->

## **Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins**

### Beat 2.1: Lead-up**

- **Event Text:** Event: A rustle from the bushes, a loud yowl of excitement, and then Anji sprints out. He runs up from behind Liska, touches her on the shoulder and asks what she's doing. His boundless energy breaks the quiet garden moment, tail twitching with eagerness, as Liska looks back startled with a funny, wide-eyed expression.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The sequence correctly defines Anji as impulsive, not malicious. The added sound effect ("rustle," "yowl") is a good sensory lead-in.
  - **Critique:** Is a simple touch on the shoulder a strong enough boundary cross to justify the subsequent emotional escalation? For many children, this is a standard play initiation.
  - **Suggestion:** The justification comes from the *combination* of factors. The prose must link them: it's the sudden noise from behind *plus* the unexpected physical contact that shatters her deep focus (established in 1.2) and causes the startle.

<!-- WRITER: Build more anticipation. Show Liska in deep creative flow first - maybe she's choosing the PERFECT shade of blue for Papa's spots. Then: rustle-rustle-RUSTLE... "LISKA!" Anji's paw lands on her shoulder mid-stroke. The touch itself should feel more invasive - maybe his paw is still damp from morning dew, or he grabs rather than touches. Make the boundary violation clearer. -->

### **2.2: The Catalyst (Misstep / Misjudgment / Accidental Event)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska startles at Anji's sudden approach, her body tensing with a small jump. Anji, without waiting for a response, reached right past her for the red marker, but in his haste, his paw bumped the water cup. Splash! A big puddle spread across Liska's picture, surprising even himself as he froze for a moment with the marker still in paw.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** Framing the incident as a clear accident is crucial for Anji's character. The cause-and-effect is now very clear.
  - **Critique:** Liska's reaction is purely passive (she tenses). Giving her a micro-moment of pre-emptive, failed protection would heighten her sense of helplessness and justify her indignation.
  - **Suggestion:** Add a small, instinctive action for Liska. "Liska jumped, instinctively pulling her drawing an inch closer. But it wasn't fast enough. As Anji reached..." This shows her trying to protect her space, making the failure to do so more emotionally impactful.

<!-- WRITER: YES to the protective instinct! But make it more visceral: "Liska's paws shot out to shield her drawing - but Anji was already reaching. His elbow knocked the water cup. Time slowed. The cup tipped... wobbled... SPLASH!" Use short sentences to create urgency. Show the water spreading across Mama's carefully drawn smile. -->

### **2.3: The Core Incident (The External Problem / Challenge)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska freezes as Anji ruins her drawing, feeling her face get hot with a burning sensation, her tail shooting straight up and puffing out as she stares at the ruined drawing with big, shocked eyes. She growls at Anji, her voice sharp and trembling with indignation over the boundary violation, and swipes with a paw to push him back, accidentally tearing her drawing in the process, the sound of ripping paper echoing her immediate distress and regret.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** This sequence is psychologically superb. "Face get hot" perfectly introduces the `Wildfire` metaphor. Liska tearing her *own* drawing is a masterful plot point that internalizes the conflict. The progression from freeze to verbal to physical action is a clear depiction of dysregulation.
  - **Critique:** While excellent, the "swipes with a paw to push him back" could be ambiguous. A swipe can imply claws and aggression. The "accidental" tear is key, but the motivation for the swipe needs to be crystal clear.
  - **Suggestion:** Clarify the intent of the swipe in the prose. "She didn't want to hurt him, she just wanted him GONE. She swiped her paw to push his hands away from the table, but her own claws caught the wet paper. Rip!" This preserves the accidental tear while making her action a clear (though dysregulated) attempt to protect her space.

<!-- WRITER: Good analysis but simplify for age 4-5. "Her face burned hot. 'NO!' The growl came from deep in her chest. She pushed at Anji's paws - get away, get AWAY! But her own claws caught the wet paper. RIIIIP! The sound was terrible. Mama's smile tore in half." Keep it physical, immediate, and heartbreaking. -->

### **2.4: Fallout**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska runs to Father crying out, 'PAPA MY DRAWING IS RUINED!', clutching the torn picture with trembling paws, tears streaming down her spotted cheeks. Her face remains hot as she struggles with the violation of her space, the distress after the ruined drawing making her cry out louder, her tail drooping as she seeks comfort from the overwhelming emotion.

<!-- WRITER: Too many emotion words. Show it: "Liska ran. The torn, wet paper flapped in her paws. 'PAPA!' Fat tears rolled down her whiskers. 'Papa, my drawing! For Mama!' She held up the ruined pieces. Inside her chest, something hot and angry burned." One emotion label at the end, after all the showing. -->

## **Act 3: Attempts to Solve / Unravel – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil**

### **3.1: Recovery (Optional)**

- **Event Text:** 'Liska's Father hugs her tightly. Asks what happened. He maintains a calm presence. He connects at eye level with a soft voice, notes "you are mad", validates her feelings with "It's okay to be so mad about this," and listens.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The described actions perfectly model co-regulation: connection and validation before correction.
  - **Critique:** The description is a technical summary of a perfect interaction. Real co-regulation can involve missteps and adjustments. Modeling this makes the parent more relatable.
  - **Suggestion:** In the prose, show the parent adjusting. "Father hugged her. 'Shh, you're okay.' Liska just cried harder, shaking her head. 'No!' Father softened his voice. 'You're right. You're not okay. You're very, very mad. And that's okay.'" This models the crucial parenting skill of listening and adapting to the child's cues.

<!-- WRITER: Keep it simpler and more physical. "Papa scooped Liska into his warm fur. She buried her face in his chest. He didn't say anything at first - just held her while she shook with angry tears. Then, very soft: 'Oh, little one. You're so mad about your drawing.'" Max 3 exchanges, physical first. -->

### **3.2: Attempt 1 (Ask adult to solve it for her)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska, still sniffling with a hot face burning from indignation, asks Father to tell Anji never-never to do that again, her voice pleading as she clutches his fur. Father gently replies with a reassuring tone, 'Let's find a way for you to tell Anji,' guiding her with a soft question, 'What could you say to him?' to encourage her own solution rather than solving it for her, though Liska still looks unsure and frustrated.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The dialogue is authentic and correctly models the transfer of agency from parent to child. It respects the user's constraint.
  - **Critique:** The father's pivot to a skills-based solution is very direct and skilled. It risks feeling a bit too much like a "teachable moment."
  - **Suggestion:** Add a step of validation before the pivot. Father: "I hear you. You want to make sure he understands he can't do that again." (This validates her goal). "How can *we* make sure he understands? What are the words *you* could use?" (This pivots to agency). The extra beat makes the guidance feel more collaborative.

<!-- WRITER: The user is right - the extra validation makes it MORE formulaic. Keep father's response simple and child-led: "'You tell Anji! Tell him never-never!' Liska demanded. Papa nodded slowly. 'Mmm. What words would make Anji understand?' This respects her anger while gently redirecting. -->

### **3.3: Attempt 2 (Developing Approach / New Complication)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Father introduces 'Spot' and 'Stop,' explaining how her body sends signals like a warning, asking her what she feels, names the sensations and introduces Wildfire. He demonstrates a deep 'Snow Leopard Breath' and a paw press to calm the 'Wildfire' inside, but Liska struggles, her tail puffing up again as she tries to breathe deeply. She notices her hot face with a small 'Oh!' but can't quite calm down, her breaths coming out shaky and fast, leaving her feeling distressed and unable to fully ease the burning sensation.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The partial failure of the coping strategy is a crucial and realistic plot point that drives the story forward.
  - **Critique:** The metaphor of 'Wildfire' is introduced *by* the father, making it a top-down lesson. Greater ownership would come from co-creation.
  - **Suggestion:** Guide Liska to the metaphor. Father: "When your face gets hot like that, what does it feel like inside?" Liska: "Like... it's hot and prickly and all over the place!" Father: "Exactly. Like a little wildfire in your tummy. And a wildfire needs..." This makes the metaphor *hers*, increasing her connection to the concept.

<!-- WRITER: Love the co-creation idea! Make it even simpler: "Papa touched her hot cheek. 'What's happening in there?' Liska scrunched her face. 'It's... burning! Like fire!' Papa's eyes went wide. 'A fire inside? Oh my. When there's a fire, what do we do?' 'Blow it out?' 'Let's try together.'" Keep the language concrete and the discovery mutual. -->

### **3.4: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska feels overwhelmed, her face burning hot as she dwells on the boundary issue, the memory of Anji's actions replaying in her mind like a stubborn thorn. She jumps up and stomps her foot. 'It's not working!' she cries, turning away from her father to hide her face, feeling defeated by her inability to calm the wildfire of indignation raging inside her.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The low point is correctly identified as an internal struggle with emotional regulation, not an external problem. The added physical action is strong.
  - **Critique:** Her frustration is directed generally. To make the emotional logic tighter, she could direct her frustration at the *tool* she was just taught. This is a common form of resistance in children.
  - **Suggestion:** Have her specifically articulate her frustration with the proposed solution. "'That silly breathing doesn't work!' she cried, stomping her foot. 'It won't blow the fire out!'" This rejection of the tool raises the stakes for the next recovery beat.

<!-- WRITER: Exactly right - kids reject tools when overwhelmed. "Liska tried the big breath. Once. Twice. The fire just burned HOTTER! 'Your silly breathing makes it WORSE!' She stomped both feet. 'The fire won't go out! I HATE breathing!'" This authentic frustration makes the eventual success more meaningful. -->

### **3.5: Recovery**

- **Event Text:** Event: Mother joins for co-regulation, hugging Liska warmly with a tender embrace to calm her enough to try again, her fur soft against Liska's cheek. She whispers gently, 'It's okay to feel upset, my little snowflake,' validating her emotions with a soothing tone, sitting close to provide a safe space as Liska's sobs begin to quiet, her body slowly relaxing into the comfort while still carrying a flicker of frustration.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The introduction of a second caregiver models a strong support system.
  - **Critique:** The mother's appearance, while well-intentioned, can feel like a *deus ex machina*. Her arrival needs to be motivated.
  - **Suggestion:** As per the user's note, keep this beat very concise. "Liska turned away from her father. He looked up and saw Mother watching from the doorway, a knowing softness in her eyes. Father nodded. She came and wrapped Liska in a warm, quiet hug, and Liska finally let her tense body relax." This is shown almost entirely through action, respecting word count while providing logical motivation.

<!-- WRITER: Perfect suggestion but even tighter: "A shadow fell across them. Mama. Without words, she wrapped Liska in the softest hug. Liska melted into familiar warmth - Mama smelled like morning tea and safety." Pure physical comfort, no verbal processing. Let the body lead. -->

### **3.6: Re-evaluation**

- **Event Text:** Event: Mother and Liska roleplay with toys under the pergola, Liska succeeds at 'Stop,' taking deep 'Snow Leopard Breaths' with a determined little puff, her chest rising and falling more steadily. Mother introduces 'Shift' as a boundary phrase, saying with a smile, 'Just say, "Please ask first,"' as they act out a scene with a plush snow leopard and other cat toys. Liska nods with determination, raising the plush's paw up and saying 'Stop!' to the other toys in a small but firm voice, practicing how to protect her space in a playful, safe setting, her tail flicking with growing confidence.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** Using toys for role-play is the gold standard for teaching social skills to this age group. It allows Liska to achieve success in a low-stakes environment, building confidence.
  - **Critique:** The solution ("Please ask first") is given to her directly by the mother. To increase Liska's agency, she could be guided to the solution herself.
  - **Suggestion:** Use guided discovery for the "Shift" phrase. Mother: "After you 'Stop', what do you wish Anji would do differently?" Liska: "I wish he would ASK!" Mother: "That's it! Those are the helpful words. Let's practice saying, 'Please ask first.'" This makes the solution feel like it comes from Liska.

<!-- WRITER: Good but streamline the toy play. "Mama grabbed two toy cats. 'I'm Anji!' She bounced the orange cat toward Liska's snow leopard. 'Can I—' 'STOP!' Liska made her leopard stand tall. The fire inside felt smaller already. 'Now what?' Mama asked. Liska thought hard. 'He should... ask me first?' 'Show me.' The practice should feel like play, not therapy. -->

## **Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally**

### **4.1: Final Attempt / Approach (Applying New Understanding / Changed Behaviour)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska returns to the drawing table in the garden the next day, sneaking comically with high steps, her spotted tail swaying cautiously as she looks warily around for Anji with comically exaggerated furtive glances, her eyes wide and ears perked. Anji bounces in excitedly, yowling with his usual boundless energy, his cream fur with brown points catching the light, and reaches for Liska's paints again without asking, his cape flapping dramatically as he leans over her new drawing with eager paws.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The setup is excellent. Anji repeating the same boundary-crossing behavior is realistic and necessary. The comedic touches add fun.
  - **Critique:** Anji's repeat offense could make him seem unlikable if not handled carefully.
  - **Suggestion:** Add a small line of internal thought for Anji or a visual cue showing his intent is positive. For example: "Anji saw Liska's new drawing and thought it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He wanted to add the perfect color to help!" This reinforces his good intentions despite his poor execution.

<!-- WRITER: User is right - that's too wordy. Show it simply: "The next morning, Liska crept to her table like a tiny spy. New drawing. New start. Then - familiar rustling! Anji bounded over. 'Ooh, pretty!' His paw reached straight for her yellow paint." The "Ooh, pretty!" shows his positive intent in just two words. -->

### **4.2: Rising Tension / Suspense**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska feels familiar emotional signals, her face heating up with indignation as the familiar burn creeps into her cheeks, and notices them with 'Spot,' thinking to herself, 'There's that wildfire again.' Her tail puffs up and stiffens as tension rolls in from the potential boundary violation, her heart beating faster while she grips the edge of the table, the memory of the ruined drawing flashing in her mind.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The text clearly shows Liska successfully using the "Spot" skill, linking the physical sensation to the metaphor.
  - **Critique:** The internal thought, "There's that wildfire again," is very explicit. For a more literary and visual approach, we can show this recognition instead of stating it.
  - **Suggestion:** As the user noted, a simpler internal cue is better. The prose can state: "She felt the heat rise in her cheeks. *The hot feeling*, she thought." This is a direct, simple recognition that shows she has learned the signal without complex internal monologue.

<!-- WRITER: Even simpler: "Her cheeks burned. Hot. Getting hotter. She knew this feeling now. Her paws pressed together - squeeze, squeeze." Show the recognition through immediate action, not thought. The body remembers what to do. -->

### **4.3: The Turning Point / Final Push (Demonstrating Growth in Action)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska takes a deep 'Snow Leopard Breath' with 'Stop,' her chest rising slowly as she inhales like smelling a mountain flower. She presses her paws hard together in front of her chest with a funny, concentrated face, feeling the squeeze steady her. Then exhales and relaxes. She raises a paw hesitantly but with resolve, her voice a little shaky but clear, 'Stop!' as she looks directly at him, her tail still puffed but her stance firm with newfound determination.

<!-- WRITER: Good bones but make the breath more concrete: "Liska sucked in air like a snow leopard smelling storm winds. Her paws pressed together so hard they trembled. Whooooosh - out came the breath, long and cool. The fire inside got smaller. She stood tall. Looked right at Anji. 'STOP!'" Physical first, then verbal. -->

### **4.4: Success (External Problem Resolved)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Anji blinks in surprise, his blue eyes wide, ears twitching back as he pulls his paw away from the paints. Liska uses 'Shift,' establishing the boundary firmly, 'It's my drawing. You must ask for permission,' her voice steadier now. Shocked by her command, he hesitates, his tail flicking uncertainly, then yowls softly with a sheepish look, 'Can I draw too?' showing a shift in his behavior as he respects her space for the first time.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The two-part boundary setting ("Stop!" then the full phrase) is a strong, realistic sequence. Anji's compliance is the clear external success marker.
  - **Critique:** Anji's motivation for complying could be clearer. Is he simply yielding, or is there a moment of understanding?
  - **Suggestion:** As noted by the user, this is a moment of confusion and dawning self-reflection for Anji. Add a concise detail: "Anji pulled his paw back, confused. Liska's voice wasn't yelling, it was... strong. He saw her serious face and for the first time, understood he had crossed a line. 'Oh,' he said softly." This frames his compliance as a response to her newfound confidence and his own moment of empathy.

<!-- WRITER: Show Anji's dawning understanding physically: "Anji froze. His paw hung in the air. Liska wasn't crying this time. She was... different. Standing tall like a real snow leopard. 'My drawing,' she said, clear as mountain water. 'Ask first.' Anji's ears flattened. His tail drooped. 'Oh... Can I draw too?'" The physical cues show his realization. -->

### **4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief (Accomplishment & Positive Emotion)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska feels tension leave her body, her face cooling down as the burning sensation fades. She nods gently, 'Okay, let's draw.' Anji lets out a happy yip. 'Hooray!' A small smile breaks through on Liska's face, her tail relaxing and swaying slightly, feeling a sense of relief wash over her like a cool breeze, her heart lighter knowing she protected her space successfully.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The somatic description of relief ("face cooling down") is a powerful close to the emotional loop. Anji's positive reaction is a great external reward.
  - **Critique:** The reward for Anji could be made more explicit, reinforcing that his new, positive behavior (asking) gets a positive result.
  - **Suggestion:** When Liska says "Okay, let's draw," have her follow it with a small act of generosity. "Okay. You can use the sparkly blue one first if you want." This actively rewards his asking, making it more likely he will repeat the behavior.

<!-- WRITER: I agree with user - extra generosity feels forced. Keep it simple: "The fire went out. Just like that. Cool swept through Liska from ears to tail. 'Yes,' she said. 'We can draw together.' Anji bounced. 'Yay!' And for the first time all morning, Liska's purr came back." The return of her purr shows the complete resolution. -->

## **Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth**

### **5.1: Relaxation / Immediate Aftermath (Processing the Journey)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska and Anji draw together at the small table in the garden, side by side under the morning sun, with Anji being careful for once, pausing to yowl softly for permission before reaching for a crayon. Anji asks with a bouncy little tilt of his head, 'Can I use this color?' showing a small, eager effort to be considerate, while Liska nods with a contented purr, their brushes moving in harmony over the paper.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The scene clearly shows the new, healthier dynamic in action.
  - **Critique:** As the user noted, the scene is too passive and quiet. It shows peaceful co-existence but not the joyful reconnection of friendship.
  - **Suggestion:** Instead of quiet drawing, have them engage in playful comparison related to the drawing. Since they are drawing their families, Anji could hold up his drawing and say, "Look! I gave my dad a super long tail!" Liska giggles and holds up hers, "Well, my mama has the prettiest spots!" This turns the activity into a dynamic, fun, and connecting game.

<!-- WRITER: Yes! Make it playful: "They drew side by side. 'Can I use green?' Anji asked. 'Yes!' Liska added enormous whiskers to Papa. Anji peeked over. 'Wow! My papa needs big whiskers too!' He drew whiskers so long they went off the page. They giggled. This was better than drawing alone." Show the friendship mending through shared silliness. -->

### **5.2: Reflection & Learning (Internalizing the Lesson & Growth)**

- **Event Text:** Add a small interactive element with Anji to make it fun but subtle. For example, 'Liska wiggles with a giggle, thinking how breathing made her feel like a mighty snow leopard, strong and calm. She puffs out her chest playfully, catching Anji's curious glance, and chirps to herself, "I can handle anything now!" her eyes bright with her secret power.'
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The goal of showing internalization through play instead of a summary is correct.
  - **Critique:** The user rightfully pointed out that my previous suggestion was wordy. The goal is a concise, powerful image.
  - **Suggestion:** Focus on a new internal metaphor that is short and evocative. **"A new purr rumbled in Liska's chest, deep and steady. Not a happy-drawing purr, but a safe-mountain purr. It felt strong."** This is concise, contrasts two positive emotional states (joy vs. secure-calm), and reinforces the story's themes of safety and self-efficacy without being overly verbose.

<!-- WRITER: Beautiful suggestion from the reviewer! But simplify even more: "A new purr lived in Liska's chest now. Not her drawing-purr. Something deeper. Stronger. Like mountain stone." This uses the metaphor of solidity/strength while keeping language concrete and brief. -->

### **5.3: Making it Right / Integration (Acknowledging & Embodying Change)**

- **Event Text:** Add a small resolution to the chase for deeper bonding. For example, 'Anji, with a mischievous glint, snatches a stray leaf and darts off, yowling, "Catch me if you can!" Liska laughs with a delighted chirp, chasing him around the garden table, her tail bouncing. They tumble together in a giggling heap after she tags him, rebuilding trust through this lively game, a joyful harmony settling as their conflict melts into shared fun.'

<!-- WRITER: This beat should show Liska using her new skills naturally, not just playing. Try: "Later, when Zanziri reached for Liska's blue crayon, Liska didn't even think. 'Ask first, please,' she said, calm as morning mist. Zanziri blinked. 'Oh! Can I use blue?' 'Of course!' The new way felt easy now." This shows integration of the skill. -->

### **5.4: New Status Quo / Harmonious Scene (Character Transformed)**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska and Anji draw a picture each, working toward two gifts for Liska's mother, their small table covered in colorful strokes under the dawn-lit pergola. They are smiling while their purrs blend in the peaceful morning air, tails swaying in sync with a gentle rhythm, their friendship visibly stronger as they create side by side without conflict, a new understanding shining in their cooperative play.

<!-- WRITER: Good but show the transformation more clearly: "Two drawings lay finished on the table. Liska's: Mama with the biggest smile. Anji's: also Mama, with stars around her head. 'She'll love them both,' Liska said. They sat close, tails touching. The garden felt peaceful again. But different. Better." The separate drawings show maintained boundaries within friendship. -->

### **5.5: Concluding Thought / Wrap-up**

- **Event Text:** Event: Liska looks at their finished drawings, thinking happily how she learned to calm her wildfire and still keep her friend. She felt proud, and her heart was light with the joy of a mended bond.
- **Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:** The event text now contains the core lesson, as requested.
  - **Critique:** While the text is good, the prose can be tightened to deliver the final emotional punch more effectively.
  - **Suggestion:** Refine the final prose to be as powerful as possible. **"Liska looked at her beautiful drawing, then at Anji's. She felt the steady, safe-mountain purr in her chest and smiled. She knew a secret now: she could have a big, hot wildfire inside her, but she didn't have to let it burn everything down. She could use her breath and her brave words to calm the fire *and* keep her friend. And that felt like the best feeling in the world."** This is specific, reinforces the metaphors, and ends on a strong, positive emotional note.

<!-- WRITER: Too long and abstract. End with simple, powerful image: "Liska touched her chest. The fire was quiet now. But she knew it would come back sometimes - fires do that. Next time, she had her snow leopard breath. And her strong words. And her friend. That was enough." Forward-looking, acknowledging the ongoing nature of emotional regulation, but confident. -->
