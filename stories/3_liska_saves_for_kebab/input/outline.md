# Liska's Saving Adventure - Concrete Story Outline

## **Act 1: Introduction (Pages 1-3)**

**Page 1:** Liska bounces on her toes at the kitchen table. Today is market day! Father places one shiny copper bead in her small paws.

**Page 2:** "This is yours to spend," Father says with a smile. Liska clutches the warm bead. It feels smooth and round.

**Page 3:** At the market, Liska always finds something delicious right away. She never saves her bead for later.

## **Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins (Pages 4-9)**

### **Lead-up:**

**Page 4:** The market buzzes with voices and colors. Liska walks between her parents. Sweet smells drift from every stall.

### **The Catalyst (Misstep/Misjudgment):**

**Page 5:** A meat pastry catches her eye immediately. "One bead!" calls the baker. Liska hands over her glass bead quickly.

**Page 6:** The meat pastry melts on her tongue. Savory juices cover her whiskers. She licks her lips happily.

### **The Core Incident (External Problem/Challenge):**

**Page 7:** Then she smells it. Sizzling fish kebabs! Her favorite food in the whole market! Her mouth waters instantly.

**Page 8:** Liska runs to Kebab Man's stall. "One fish kebab please!" she calls out eagerly. She reaches for her bead pocket.

**Page 9:** Her pocket is empty. No warm glass bead. No money at all. Her ears droop sadly.

## **Act 3: Attempts to Solve – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil (Pages 10-25)**

### **Attempt 1 (Initial Reaction):**

**Page 10:** Next market day, Liska grips her bead tightly. The meat pastry smell makes her nose twitch. She shakes her head firmly.

**Page 11:** She walks past the bakery stall. Her paws reach toward the pastries. She pulls them back quickly and sits on them.

**Page 12:** At Kebab Man's stall, she proudly shows her one bead. "How much for kebab?" she asks hopefully.

**Page 13:** "Three beads," Kebab Man says kindly. Liska's mouth falls open. Her ears flatten completely against her head. Three whole beads?!

**Page 14:** Liska trudges back to her parents with droopy whiskers. Father notices her sad face immediately.

**Page 15:** "What happened, little one?" Father asks gently. "I want kebab but only have one bead," she sniffles miserably.

**Page 16:** "You need to save money, little one," Father explains. "Keep beads until you have enough."

### **Attempt 2 (Developing Approach):**

**Page 17:** The next market day brings another bead. Liska now has two beads total! She feels proud.

**Page 18:** She walks past the meat pastry stall. The savory smell makes her stomach rumble loudly.

**Page 19:** "Just one tiny pastry," she whispers. But she forces herself to walk past it quickly.

**Page 20:** At the kebab stall, two beads still aren't enough. Liska's shoulders slump. This is so hard!

### **Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback):**

**Page 21:** She buys TWO meat pastries instead. They taste wonderful... for about three bites. Then she feels worse than before.

**Page 22:** At home, Liska stares at her empty paws. Zero beads again. This keeps happening over and over!

### **Re-evaluation/Insight:**

**Page 23:** Father finds her sitting sadly on her bed. "What's wrong, little snow leopard?"

**Page 24:** "I'll never get my kebab!" Liska wails. "Saving is too hard! I always spend the beads!"

**Page 25:** Father disappears into his workshop. He returns with something that glows softly blue.

## **Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally (Pages 26-40)**

### **Final Attempt (Applying New Understanding):**

**Page 26:** "This is a magic savings jar," he says. "It has three slots for three beads."

**Page 27:** "When you get tempted at market, your beads stay safely at home. No spending them by accident!"

**Page 28:** The next market day, Liska drops her bead into the jar. One slot glows bright blue!

**Page 29:** At the market, her paws feel empty but her heart feels light. One bead safely saved!

### **Rising Tension/Suspense:**

**Page 30:** Second market day arrives. Liska stares at her jar with two glowing slots. Should she take the beads with her?

**Page 31:** Her paws hover over the jar. "Just in case," she whispers. But what if she spends them again?

**Page 32:** She picks up the jar, then puts it down. Picks it up again. Father watches quietly.

### **The Turning Point (Demonstrating Growth):**

**Page 33:** "Leave it home," she tells herself firmly. She forces herself to walk away from the glowing jar.

**Page 34:** The meat pastry smell is extra strong today. Liska's stomach growls loudly and longingly.

**Page 35:** She starts walking toward the baker. Then she remembers her glowing jar at home.

**Page 36:** "Not today, meat pastry," she whispers. She turns away and walks to her parents instead.

### **Success (External Problem Resolved):**

**Page 37:** Third market day! Liska's paws shake as she drops the final bead in. All three slots glow!

**Page 38:** The jar pulses with bright blue light. "KEBAB DAY!" Liska shouts. She dances around the kitchen.

### **Immediate Reward/Relief:**

**Page 39:** At the market, Liska runs straight to Kebab Man. She waves her glowing jar high overhead.

**Page 40:** "Three beads for one kebab!" she announces proudly. She pours the warm glass beads into his palm.

## **Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth (Pages 41-43)**

### **Relaxation/Immediate Aftermath:**

**Page 41:** The fish kebab is perfect. Crispy outside, flaky inside. The best taste she's ever experienced!

### **Reflection & Learning + Making it Right/Integration:**

**Page 42:** "Thank you for the magic jar, Father," Liska says between delicious bites.

### **Concluding Thought/Wrap-up:**

**Page 43:** "What should I save for next?" she wonders. Maybe something even more special than kebabs!
