# Act 1: Introduction

## 1.1: Introduce setting and atmosphere
- **Event**: Liska sits in a garden at dawn, with the sky turning pink, creating a calm and creative atmosphere.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 1: 'Однажды, Лиска сидела и рисовала картину в подарок маме.')
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: The serene garden setting is relatable and comforting for 4-6 year-olds, aligning with their need for safe, familiar environments (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Safe and predictable environments').
- **Realism Check**: This is both desirable (calm start) and realistic (children often engage in quiet activities like drawing in familiar spaces). However, I challenge if the dawn setting might be too abstract for some children to grasp—should we specify 'early morning' instead for clarity?

## 1.2: Introduce character(s)
- **Event**: Liska is shown drawing a gift for her mother, purring loudly with joy, tail swaying, displaying her capacity for intense positive emotions.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 1: 'Она мурлыкала, а её хвост радостно качался из стороны в сторону.')
- **Characters Introduced**: Liska (main character).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Drawing as a creative activity is highly relatable (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Engage in creative expression'). Purring as a sign of happiness is a concrete, animalistic trait that children can understand as joy.
- **Realism Check**: Desirable (showing joy through creative expression) and realistic (children often show happiness through physical cues like humming or fidgeting). I challenge if purring alone is enough to convey intense emotion—should we add a facial expression or dialogue to reinforce this for clarity?

# Act 2: Inciting Incident – The Challenge Begins

## 2.1: Lead-up
- **Event**: Anji suddenly runs up from behind the bushes, loudly asking Liska what she's doing, interrupting her calm moment.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 2: 'Вдруг к ней со спины подбежал Анжи. — Лиска! Что ты делаешь? Можно посмотреть? — спросил Анжи.')
- **Slot `Fun`**: Nurture Fun (Liska's endearing purring before interruption).
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Empathy (connecting with Liska's initial happiness before disruption).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Anji's interruption mirrors common peer interactions where boundaries are tested, relatable for the age group (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning to navigate peer interactions').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (children often interrupt without malice) and desirable (sets up a teachable moment). I challenge if Anji's loud approach might be too abrupt—should we soften it with a playful tone to avoid seeming aggressive?

## 2.2: The Catalyst (Misstep / Misjudgment / Accidental Event)
- **Event**: Liska startles at Anji's sudden approach, and Anji, without waiting for permission, grabs a marker and draws on her picture, specifically on her mother's face in the drawing.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 4: 'Анжи "а можно мне тоже", не дождался ответа и хватает фломастер и начинает рисовать на ее картинке.')
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Surprise (Anji's unexpected action).
- **Slot `Fun`**: Physical Comedy (Anji's impulsive grabbing and drawing).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Anji's impulsivity is age-appropriate for a peer character, reflecting lack of impulse control common at this age (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Developing impulse control').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (children often act impulsively) but not desirable (boundary violation). I challenge if drawing on the mother's face is too personal a violation—would spilling something be less emotionally charged and more accidental, or is this specificity crucial for emotional impact?

## 2.3: The Core Incident (The External Problem / Challenge)
- **Event**: Liska freezes as Anji ruins her drawing, feeling her face get hot, tail twitch, and chest tighten, signaling emotional distress.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 4: 'Лиска замерла. Она почувствовала, как её лицо становится горячим. Хвост начал резко дёргаться. В груди что-то сжалось и забилось быстрее.')
- **Slot `Fun`**: None.
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Tension (Anji ruining Liska's drawing).
- **Slot `Emotional Trigger`**: Violation of Personal Space / Boundaries.
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: The physical description of emotional distress is concrete and relatable, helping children connect bodily sensations to feelings (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Beginning to identify physical sensations with emotions').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (physical reactions to stress are common) and desirable (teaches body awareness). I challenge if the multiple physical signs (hot face, twitching tail, tight chest) might overwhelm a young reader—should we focus on one or two key sensations for simplicity?

## 2.4: Fallout
- **Event**: Liska growls loudly at Anji, saying he ruined everything, and accidentally tears her drawing in anger, showing immediate regret.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 5: '— Ты всё испортил! — зарычала Лиска так громко, что Анжи отпрыгнул. Она царапнула когтями по рисунку. Рисунок порвался.')
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Emotional Impact (Liska's distress).
- **Slot `Emotion Group Triggered`**: Anger / Indignation.
- **Slot `Dysregulation`**: Verbal Aggression (growling and shouting) and Physical Aggression (tearing the drawing).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Growling and tearing as expressions of anger are realistic for the age group, showing dysregulation in a non-harmful way (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Expressing emotions through physical actions').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (children often lash out verbally or physically when upset) but not desirable (aggression). I challenge if tearing her own drawing might be too self-destructive—would pushing Anji away be more typical, or is self-directed aggression key to showing regret and complexity? I also note that immediate regret is desirable but not always realistic—should there be a brief moment of continued anger before regret sets in for realism?

# Act 3: Attempts to Solve / Unravel – Facing the Problem & Inner Turmoil

## 3.1: Recovery
- **Event**: Liska runs to her father crying, holding the torn drawing, and he kneels down, hugs her, and offers brief validation (e.g., 'I see you're really upset').
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 6-7: 'Liska runs to her parents, crying loudly, drawing ruined... Папа обнял Лиску и погладил по спинке.')
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Empathy (connecting with Liska's sadness).
- **Slot `Regulation Strategy`**: Co-regulation.
  - **Slot `Coping Strategy`**: Physical Comfort (hugging).
  - **Slot `Fun`**: None.
  - **Slot `Support`**: Emotional and Physical (Father's comfort).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Seeking parental comfort is typical and appropriate for this age (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Seeking comfort from trusted adults').
- **Realism Check**: Both desirable (seeking help) and realistic (children run to parents when upset). Keeping it to 2 lines ensures pacing, with a brief validation for emotional depth.

## 3.2: Attempt 1 (Initial Reaction / Less Considered Approach)
- **Event**: Liska asks Father to solve the problem by telling Anji 'never-never do that again,' but Father gently refuses, saying 'I can help, but let's learn together how you can tell Anji.'
- **Source**: Adapted from discussion; not directly in input files.
- **Slot `Support`**: Emotional (Father's redirection to learning).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Relying on an adult to fix social conflicts is typical for this age (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Dependence on adults for conflict resolution').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (children often seek adult intervention) and desirable (Father pushes toward independence). The failure is implicit in Father not providing a quick solution as Liska wanted, setting up the need for her to learn.

## 3.3: Attempt 2 (Developing Approach / New Complication)
- **Event**: Father introduces 'Spot' with the 'wildfire' metaphor for indignation, asking Liska how she felt. Liska identifies sensations like hot face or twitching tail. Father then suggests 'Stop' as a way to calm the 'wildfire,' using a deep breath and paw press, but Liska fails to calm down enough, still feeling overwhelmed.
- **Source**: Adapted from Input.md (Page 8-9: '— Ты заметила что-нибудь необычное в своём теле?') and discussion.
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Discovery (learning about her feelings).
- **Slot `Fun`**: None.
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Focusing on self-awareness and a basic calming attempt is age-appropriate (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Beginning to identify physical sensations with emotions' and 'Learning simple self-regulation strategies').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (partial success in noticing feelings but inability to fully calm is common) and desirable (early steps in emotional regulation). Combining 'Spot' and a failed 'Stop' reflects a natural progression but keeps complexity manageable with clear failure.

## 3.4: Low Point (Emotional & Practical Setback)
- **Event**: Liska feels overwhelmed by her lingering indignation, expressing frustration (e.g., 'I can't make it stop!' or through physical cues like a drooping tail), focusing on her struggle with Anji's boundary violation and inability to calm down.
- **Source**: Adapted from discussion; not directly in input files.
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Emotional Impact (Liska's frustration).
- **Slot `Emotional Trigger`**: Continued Violation of Boundaries (reflecting on Anji's actions).
- **Slot `Emotion Group Triggered`**: Indignation.
- **Slot `Dysregulation`**: Emotional Overwhelm (frustration or sadness).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Showing frustration with inability to manage emotions is relatable (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Experiencing intense emotions').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (children often feel defeated when skills don't work immediately) and undesirable (negative emotional peak). Focusing on indignation over Anji's actions keeps the theme central, avoiding dilution by over-emphasizing the drawing.

## 3.5: Recovery
- **Event**: Mother joins for a very short co-regulation, calming Liska enough to try again (e.g., a brief hug or comforting word, reinforcing that it's okay to struggle).
- **Source**: Adapted from Input.md (Page 16-17: 'Тут к ним подошла мама...') and discussion.
- **Slot `Regulation Strategy`**: Co-regulation.
  - **Slot `Coping Strategy`**: Physical Comfort (hugging or gentle encouragement).
  - **Slot `Support`**: Emotional (Mother's reassurance).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: A second, brief co-regulation aligns with the need for repeated adult support (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Seeking comfort from trusted adults').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (needing additional support after a low point) and desirable (models persistent care). Keeping it short (1-2 lines) maintains pacing.

## 3.6: Re-evaluation
- **Event**: Father and Mother roleplay with toys, allowing Liska to succeed at 'Stop' (deep breath, possibly paw press) in a low-stress environment. Mother briefly introduces 'Shift' as 'just saying: Please ask first,' and Liska understands with a reaction like 'Huh, that I can do,' mentally preparing to face Anji.
- **Source**: Adapted from Input.md (Page 17: 'Они взяли игрушки и стали разыгрывать разные ситуации.') and discussion.
- **Slot `Solution Discovery Process`**: Scaffolding and Guided Discovery.
- **Slot `Coping Strategy`**: Somatic (deep breathing practice).
- **Slot `Support`**: Instructional (from both parents).
- **Slot `Practice`**: Symbolic Play (role-playing with toys).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Toy practice is ideal for integration, and a brief introduction to 'Shift' sets up Act 4 (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning through play').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (practice builds confidence) and desirable (reinforces skills). Introducing 'Shift' briefly at the end avoids overload in Act 3, acting as a teaser for Act 4 application.

# Act 4: Climax & Solution – Overcoming Externally & Internally

## 4.1: Final Attempt / Approach
- **Event**: Anji returns the next day, sees Liska drawing, and reaches for her paints without asking. Liska mentally recalls 'Spot' and 'Stop,' preparing to apply 'Shift' (a simple boundary phrase like 'Please ask first') as the final step.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 22: 'На следующий день Анжи снова пришёл в гости... — Давай играть твоими красками!') and discussion.
- **Slot `Fun`**: None.
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Anticipation (will Liska manage her emotions?).
- **Slot `Coping Strategy`**: Somatic (deep breath) and Behavioral (boundary phrase).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Applying 'Shift' here as the final piece reinforces independence (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Repetition for learning').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (boundary issues recur) and desirable (opportunity to show growth). Recalling 'Shift' from a brief introduction in 3.6 ensures Liska applies it independently, reinforcing agency.

## 4.2: Rising Tension / Suspense
- **Event**: Liska feels familiar signals (hot face, tight chest, twitching tail) and internally recalls 'Spot' to notice them.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 23: 'Лиска почувствовала знакомые сигналы: жар в лице, напряжение в груди, подёргивание хвоста. "Обрати внимание", — вспомнила она.')
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Tension (Liska feeling signals again).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Recognizing bodily signals reinforces earlier learning, suitable for the age group (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Beginning to identify physical sensations with emotions').
- **Realism Check**: Realistic (stress signals recur) and desirable (self-awareness). I challenge if internal monologue ('Обрати внимание') is too advanced for a 4-6 year-old—should this be a visual cue or parental reminder instead for realism, or is it acceptable as a narrative device?

## 4.3: The Turning Point / Final Push
- **Event**: Liska takes a deep breath ('Stop'), presses her paws together if needed, and calmly tells Anji to ask before taking her things ('Shift').
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 24-25: '"Возьми паузу". Лиска сделала снежный вдох... — Анжи, пожалуйста, спроси прежде, чем брать мои вещи.')
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Triumph (Liska applying learned skills).
- **Slot `Fun`**: None.
- **Slot `Coping Strategy`**: Physical (pressing paws if included), Behavioral (boundary phrase).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Applying multiple strategies shows growth and is age-appropriate if kept simple (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning simple self-regulation strategies').
- **Realism Check**: Desirable (successful application) but potentially unrealistic—children often falter on first real attempts. I challenge if Liska's success is too perfect—should her voice waver more or Anji initially resist to show realistic struggle, or is clear success better for modeling behavior?

## 4.4: Success (External Problem Resolved)
- **Event**: Anji blinks in surprise, apologizes, and asks if he can draw with her, respecting her boundary.
- **Source**: Input.md (Page 26: 'Анжи удивлённо моргнул и прижал уши: — Прости, Лиска. Можно мне рисовать вместе с тобой?')
- **Outcome**: Anji respects Liska's boundary.
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Positive peer response to boundary-setting teaches social skills (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning to negotiate with peers').
- **Realism Check**: Desirable (conflict resolution) but slightly unrealistic—children might not apologize so readily. I challenge if Anji's immediate compliance is too ideal—should there be a moment of hesitation or negotiation for realism, or is quick resolution better for story closure?

## 4.5: Immediate Reward / Relief
- **Event**: Liska feels tension leave her chest and smiles, agreeing to let Anji draw with her.
- **Source**: Draft.md (4.5: 'Лиска почувствовала, как напряжение в груди уходит. Она кивнула. — Конечно, можно, — сказала она, и впервые за весь день искренне улыбнулась.')
- **Outcome**: Liska feels relief and smiles.
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Emotional relief as a reward is relatable and reinforcing (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Positive reinforcement for behavior').
- **Realism Check**: Both desirable and realistic (success often brings relief). I challenge if the relief is described too subtly—should there be a more overt physical sign (like a relaxed tail) for children to notice the change?

# Act 5: Resolution & Conclusion – Integrating the Growth

## 5.1: Relaxation / Immediate Aftermath
- **Event**: Liska and Anji draw together at the table, with Anji being careful and asking permission before taking paint.
- **Source**: Draft.md (5.1: 'Они устроились за столиком и стали рисовать вместе. Анжи очень старался быть аккуратным.')
- **Slot `Fun`**: Nurture Fun (shared drawing).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Shared activity post-conflict shows friendship restoration, appropriate for social learning (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning to cooperate with peers').
- **Realism Check**: Desirable (cooperation) and realistic (children can bond over shared tasks after conflict). I challenge if Anji's carefulness is too sudden—should there be a small slip-up to show gradual learning, or is this ideal behavior better for closure?

## 5.2: Reflection & Learning
- **Event**: Liska reflects that the 'Snow Leopard Breath' helps and shows Anji how to do it.
- **Source**: Draft.md (5.2: '— Знаешь, — сказала Лиска через некоторое время, — а "снежный вдох" и правда помогает. Она показала Анжи, как это делать.')
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Calm Reflection (Liska sharing the technique).
- **Slot `Support`**: Peer Support (teaching Anji).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Teaching others reinforces learning and builds empathy, suitable for this age (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Developing empathy through shared experiences').
- **Realism Check**: Desirable (peer teaching) but slightly unrealistic—children might not teach so readily without prompting. I challenge if Liska initiating teaching is too mature—should Anji ask first, or is her initiative key to showing mastery?

<!-- We might drop the teaching comlpetely? Idk if it's necessary -->

## 5.3: Making it Right / Integration
- **Event**: Anji tries the breath, puffing his cheeks comically, and they laugh together, enjoying drawing as friends.
- **Source**: Draft.md (5.3: 'Анжи попробовал, и у него смешно надулись щёки. Они оба рассмеялись. Рисовать вместе оказалось очень весело.')
- **Slot `Engagement`**: Empathy (building friendship).
- **Slot `Support`**: Mutual Support (shared activity).
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Laughter and shared joy post-conflict model reconciliation (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning to repair relationships').
- **Realism Check**: Desirable (friendship restored) and realistic (humor often eases tension). I challenge if laughter alone is enough to show integration—should there be a verbal apology or acknowledgment from Anji for deeper resolution?

## 5.4: New Status Quo / Harmonious Scene
- **Event**: Liska and Anji finish a new, shared drawing for Liska's mother, which turns out even better than the first.
- **Source**: Draft.md (5.4: 'Вскоре они уже дорисовывали новую, общую картину для мамы Лиски. Она получилась даже лучше, чем первая.')
- **Outcome**: Liska and Anji drawing together harmoniously.
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: A new normal of cooperation shows growth (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning to cooperate with peers').
- **Realism Check**: Desirable (positive outcome) and realistic (collaboration can yield better results). I challenge if 'better than the first' is necessary—could a simple 'beautiful picture' suffice to avoid implying competition with the past?

## 5.5: Concluding Thought / Wrap-up
- **Event**: The garden echoes with their quiet, friendly purring, signaling peace and harmony.
- **Source**: Draft.md (5.5: 'И если прислушаться, то в саду можно было услышать тихое, дружное мурчание.')
- **Outcome**: Peaceful, shared purring in the garden.
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: A poetic, comforting end reinforces emotional safety (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Need for emotional safety and reassurance').
- **Realism Check**: Desirable (harmonious closure) and realistic (children often return to calm play after resolution). I challenge if 'purring' as a shared action is clear enough—should there be a final visual of them smiling together to ensure the message of friendship is unmistakable?
