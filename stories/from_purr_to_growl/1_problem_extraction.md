**1. Who are the main characters in the story?**  
**A:** Liska (protagonist), Anji (friend and source of conflict), Father Daric (supporting character providing emotional tools), Mother Mara (supporting character providing emotional tools)

---

**2. What is the single problem the story will address?**  
**A:** Liska struggles with managing big emotions, specifically indignation, when her boundaries are crossed by Anji during a creative activity.

---

**3. What are the social consequences of this problem?**  
**A:** Tension and conflict arise between Liska and Anji due to boundary violations, disrupting their friendship and playtime.

---

**4. What is the one solution the story will lead to?**  
**A:** Liska learns to recognize her emotional signals and use strategies like 'Spot, Stop, Shift' to calm herself and set boundaries with Anji.

---

**5. What specific skill will the child learn to move toward the solution?**  
**A:** Liska learns the 'Spot, Stop, Shift' method to notice her internal sensations (like a hot face or twitching tail), stop with a paw press and a deep breath, and shift by using a boundary phrase (like 'Please ask first').

---

**6. Which emotional sequences are triggered in the raw input?**  
**A:**
- Indignation -> Anger: When Anji violates Liska's boundaries by spilling water on her picture, triggering a hot face and twitching tail.
- Disappointment -> Sadness: When Liska sees her drawing ruined and accidentally tears it herself, leading to feelings of heaviness and crying.

---

**7. Are any of these emotions central to the story, or are they used transitively for the narrative and the story is not about dealing with emotions?**  
**A:** Indignation is central as the story focuses on Liska learning to manage this emotion by recognizing bodily signals and setting boundaries, while Sadness is transitive, used to deepen the emotional impact of the ruined drawing but not the primary focus of the learning journey.

---

**8. If the story is about emotional learning, what is the key emotion the problem triggers that is the most important to address developmentally?**  
**A:** Indignation (resulting from boundary violation) - It's critical for 4-6-year-olds to learn to handle indignation to build emotional resilience and develop healthy social boundaries, preventing escalation into prolonged conflict or aggression.  
**Comments:** Two best options from the raw input are Indignation and Sadness. Indignation is developmentally significant because boundary-setting is a crucial social skill at this age, helping children navigate peer interactions (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning to negotiate with peers'). Sadness is also important as it relates to loss and resilience, but in this context, it is secondary to the social conflict with Anji, which is the core of the story. I choose Indignation over Sadness because the story's resolution focuses on boundary-setting and managing social triggers, which aligns more directly with indignation.

**9. What metaphor will represent the problematic emotion or behavior?**  
**A:** Indignation will be visualized as the 'Wildfire' (Пожар) metaphor, representing the hot, spreading reaction to perceived injustice. (Sourced from @emotional_metaphors.md)

---

**10. Which ONE learned coping behavior are we introducing to help the character recover from the emotion/situation?**  
**A:** Liska learns to use the 'Spot, Stop, Shift' method, specifically focusing on taking a deep breath and pressing her paws together to pause and calm her indignation, followed by using a boundary phrase to communicate her needs. (Sourced from @learned_coping.md and supported by @coping_strategies.csv under 'Calming Our Bodies' as 'Cooling Breaths')  
**Comments:** Two best options from the raw input are the combination of a deep breath with paw pressing (a somatic and physical calming strategy) and using boundary-setting phrases (a cognitive/behavioral strategy). The deep breath with paw pressing is developmentally significant because it teaches a simple, portable self-regulation tool that children can use anywhere to manage intense emotions, aligning with the need for immediate calming (Developmental_guidelines.csv: 'Learning simple self-regulation strategies'). Boundary-setting phrases are also crucial for social skills, and together with calming, they address both the internal emotional surge and external communication needs, making this combination the priority for indignation. If outside input is considered, 'Tight Squeeze, Soft Release' from @coping_strategies.csv could be an alternative for physical grounding, but the deep breath with paw pressing is more character-specific and thematic to Liska's snow leopard identity.

**11. Write a paragraph summarizing the story.**  
**A:** In 'From Purr to Growl,' Liska, a young snow leopard, is joyfully drawing a gift for her mother when her friend Anji impulsively ruins it by spilling water on it, triggering intense indignation in Liska. Her face heats up, and in a moment of dysregulation, she growls and accidentally tears her own drawing, leading to tears and regret. Running to her parents, Father Daric and Mother Mara comfort her and teach her the 'Spot, Stop, Shift' method to notice her internal sensations, calm herself with a paw press and deep breath, and set boundaries with a phrase like 'Please ask first.' Through role-playing with toys, Liska practices these skills in a safe setting. When Anji oversteps again, Liska successfully applies her new tools, calming herself and asking him to respect her space. Anji agrees, and they draw together harmoniously, their friendly purring echoing in the garden as Liska learns to manage her big feelings and rebuild their friendship.
